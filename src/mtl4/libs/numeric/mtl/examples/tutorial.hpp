/*! \mainpage MTL4 manual

\author Peter Gottschling and Andrew Lumsdaine

Many things can be realized on a computer very elegantly and efficiently today
thanks to progress in software and programming languages.
One thing that cannot be done elegantly on a computer is computing.
At least not computing fast.

In the %Matrix Template Library 4 we aim for a natural mathematical 
notation without sacrifying performance.
You can write an expression like x = y * z and the library will
perform the according %operation: scaling a %vector, multiplying a
sparse %matrix with a dense %vector or two sparse matrices.
Some %operations like dense %matrix product use tuned BLAS implementation.
In parallel, all described %operations in this manual are also realized in C++
so that the library can be used without BLAS and is not limited to types
supported by BLAS.
For short, general applicability is combined with maximal available performance.
We developed new techniques to allow for:
- Unrolling of dynamicly sized data with user-defined block and tile sizes;
- Combining multiple %vector assignments in a single statement 
  (and more importingly perform them in one single loop);
- Storing matrices recursively in a never-before realized generality;
- Performing %operations on recursive and non-recursive matrices recursively;
- Filling compressed sparse matrices efficiently;
.
and much more.

The manual still not covers all features and techniques of the library.
But it should give you enough information to get started.

/*! \page intro Introduction




Many things can be realized on a computer very elegantly and efficiently today
thanks to progress in software and programming languages.
One thing that cannot be done elegantly on a computer is computing.
At least not computing fast.

High performance computing (HPC) is to a large extend influenced by some
highly tuned numeric libraries.
Assume we want to multiply two matrices, i.e. calculate A = B * C.
Then we can use some libraries that run at over 90 per cent peak performance.
We only need to write something like:
\code
	int m= num_rows(A), n= num_cols(B), k= num_cols(A), 
            lda= A.get_ldim(), ldb= B.get_ldim(), ldc= C.get_ldim();
	double alpha= 1.0, beta= 1.0;
	char a_trans= 'N', b_trans= 'N';
	_dgemm(&a_trans, &b_trans, &m, &n, &k, &alpha, &A[0][0], &lda, 
	       &B[0][0], &ldb, &beta, &C[0][0], &ldc);
\endcode
No doubt, next time we call dgemm we instantly remember the exact order of the 13 arguments.
Certainly, calling the C-BLAS interface looks somewhat nicer and we can write functions
that deal with the dimensions and the orientation, like dgemm(A, B, C).
We can furthermore write a polymorphic function gemm that accordingly calls _sgemm, _dgemm
and so on.
Indead, there is a project working on this.
But is this all we want?
Why not writing A = B * C; and the library calls the according BLAS function?
What do we want to do if there is none?


Programmers working with BLAS libraries
are forced to limit themselves to the %operations and types provided by these
packages.
As an example, if one likes to use single-precision floats for preconditioner
matrices--to save memory bandwidth--while the %vectors are double-valued, 
one cannot use regular BLAS libraries.
In contrast, any generic library that contains a %matrix %vector product
can perform this %operation.

And what if somebody wants to build matrices and vectors of quaternions or intervals?
Or rationals?
How to calculate on them?
Again, this is no problem with a generic library but it would take enormous implementation efforts
in Fortran or C (even more in an assembly language to squeaze out the last nano-second of run-time
(on each platform respectively)).


Mathematica and Matlab are by far more elegant than C or Fortran libraries.
And as long as one uses standard %operations as %matrix products they are fast
since they can use the tuned libraries.
As soon as you start programming your own computations looping over elements
of the matrices or vectors your performance won't be impressive, to say the least.

MTL4 allows you to write A = B * C and let you use BLAS internally if available.
Otherwise it provides you an implementation in C++ that is also reasonably fast (we usually
reached 60 per cent peak).


All this said, dense %matrix multiplication is certainly the most benchmarked %operation
on high performance computers but not really the %operation that high performance computers
use the most in real applications.
The dominant part of scientific computing in HPC are simulations that are mostly 
handled with finite element methods (FEM), finite volume methods (FVM),
finite difference methods (FDM), or alike.
The numeric problems that arise from these methods are almost ever linear or non-linear
systems of equations in terms of very large sparse matrices and dense vectors.

In contrast to most other libraries we paid strong attention to sparse matrices and their
%operations.
To start with, we developed an efficient method to fill the matrices and compress them
in-place, cf. \ref matrix_insertion.
This allows for %matrix sizes that are close to the memory size.
It is also possible to change the compressed matrices later.


The product of sparse matrices with dense ones allows you to multiply a sparse %matrix 
simultaneously with multiple vectors.
Besides cache reuse regarding the sparse %matrix simple and efficient loop unrolling
could be applied. (Performance plots still pending ;-) ) 

Sparse matrices can be multiplied very fast with MTL4.
In the typical case that the number of non-zeros per row and per column is 
limited by a constant for any dimension, 
the run-time of the multiplication is linear in the number of rows or columns.
(Remark: we did not use the condition that the number of non-zeros in the %matrix is proportional to 
the dimension. This condition includes the pathological case that the first %matrix contains
a column %vector of non-zeros and the second one a row %vector of non-zeros. Then
the complexity would be quadratic.)
Such matrices usually originate from FEM/FDM/FVM discrezations of PDEs on continous domains.
Then the number of rows and columns corresponds to the number of nodes or cells in the 
discretized domain.
Sparse %matrix products can be very useful in algebraic multigrid methods (AMG).

Returning to the expression A = B * C; it can be used to express every product of 
sparse and dense matrices.
The library will dispatch to the appropriate algorithm.
Moreover, the expression could also represent a %matrix %vector product if A and C
are column vectors (one would probably choose lower-case names though).
In fact,  x = y * z can represent four different %operations:
- %matrix product;
- %matrix %vector product;
- scalar times %matrix; or
- scalar times %vector.
.


There is much more to say about MTL.
Some of it you will find in the \ref tutorial, some of it still needs to be written.



Proceed to the \ref install "installation guide".

*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------


/*! \page install Installation guide

MTL4 is a pure template library and only the presence of the sources
is required.
The only mandatory requirement is the Boost library collection.
There are two ways to install MTL4:
- With a \ref installpackage "package manager" or
- By  \ref installdownload "downloading".
.
We recommend you the first option if you have administrative rights on your computer.
It is much easier and you will be provided with automatic updates.
Furthermore, boost will be installed as prerequisite.

\section installpackage Install with a Package Manager

We provide the MTL4 sources within 4 packages:
- "mtl" contains the headers of MTL4. This package is the only mandatory one for developing scientific applications.
- "mtl-examples" contains documentation of MTL4.
- "mtl-tests" provides our test suite if you like to check whether the library is properly installed and if your platform is well supported.
- "mtl-all" is a meta-package that install the entire MTL4 sources (i.e. the previous 3 packages).

\subsection debian Installation under Debian, Ubuntu and other .deb-based Linux Distributions

-# Open your package source manager (you find this in the menu System -> Administration -> Software Sources).
-# Go to tab "Other Sources", click on "Add" and insert the line:\n
   <tt>deb http://www.simunova.com/debian main/</tt>\n
   then save and close the package source manager. 
-# Open the package manage (you find this in the menu System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager)
   and "Reload".
-# Click on "Quick search" and type "mtl".
-# Mark the MTL4 packages you want and "Apply" for the installation. Accept all dependent packages.

Your package will warn that you are going to install non-authorized packages.
We will provide signatures later. For the time being please accept the installation as it is.

\subsection rpm  Installation under SuSE, Fedora and other .rpm-based Linux Distribution

-# add the url repository \n
   <tt> http://www.simunova.com/rpm </tt>\n
   to your repository list and update.
   - There will be 2 error messages that come from missing signature.
     Please ignore this warning for the moment.
     Later we will add this signatures to avoid these errors.
-# Search the package "mtl" in your package manager
-# Mark the desired packages and accept all dependent packages.

\subsection installwindows Installation under Windows

This is under development and will be provided soon. For the time being please use \ref installdownload "an archive".

\section installdownload Install a Downloaded Archive

To compile an MTL4 application you only need to
-# <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/download/">Download and install Boost.</a>
-# <a href="http://www.simunova.com/en/node/145">Download and install MTL4.</a>
-# Include the libraries in the compile command when not installed in the include path, e.g.\n
  <tt>g++ myapp.cpp -o myapp -I/usr/local/include/boost-1.44 -I/usr/local/include/mtl4</tt>
.

<b>Download and install Boost:</b>
One can do this by hand: download it from the 
<a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost web page</a>
and unpack it in an appropriate directory.
If you have administrator rights on the used computer you can put boost in a directory
in the include path, e.g. /usr/local/include.
Then you can omit the compiler flag for including from the boost directory. 
If multiple versions shall be used on your computer you can only put one in the include path
or you need extra tools like softenv or module to deal with your paths.
More convenient is the installation of boost with a packet manager like synaptic.
We use in the development and testing currently versions between 1.38 and 1.44.
Some earlier versions might work as well but not 1.33 or earlier (e.g. type %traits for
std::complex are missing there).
 The parts of boost used in MTL4 do not need
to be compiled but only included (except for the Supercomputing Edition which is
documented seperately).


<b>Download MTL4:</b>



Archives are found on the 
<a href="http://www.simunova.com/en/node/145">MTL4 download page</a>.
They are updated weekly.
In principle, MTL4 headers can also be copied in a directory within the standard include
path to omit the compiler flag for its inclusion.

For working with the latest version, you can check out the current trunk.
As version control we use "subversion" which is contained in any Linux distribution.
On Windows we recommend 
<a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">Tortoise</a>.
Go to the directory where you like MTL4 to reside and type:\n
<tt>svn checkout https://svn.simunova.com/svn/mtl4/trunk mtl4</tt>\n
The adventage of version control is that you can update it easily with\n
<tt>svn update</tt>\n
when new features are added or a bug is %fixed (fortunately not needed very often).


<b>Install MTL4 on Linux:</b>
MTL4 does not need an installation.
You can simply put the files into any directory you like.
In this case you need to pass the directory as flag when you compile your applications, e.g.:\n
<tt>g++ -I/home/joe/mtl4 ...</tt>\n
After extracting, you will have extra prefixes in your file names.
For instance, if you extract an MTL4 archive
in <tt>/home/joe/download</tt> then you need to compile with\n
<tt>g++ -I/home/joe/download/<archivename>/usr/include ...</tt>\n
or you copy the content of <tt><archivename>/usr/include</tt>
into a shorter path

To avoid the -I flag altogether, you can copy the headers into <tt>/usr/include</tt>.
The MTL4 and the boost directory can be mixed in principle since their files are
disjoint (but not all directories).

<b>On Windows:</b>
If you compile MTL4 with VS2005/08/10 or its free express version
you need to install the SDK (some boost files access to it).
Please make sure that the compiler is in the path.
Then cmake (or scons) will find it.

Additionally, you have to tell the compiler where the header files and
the libraries of VC and the Software Developing Kit are located, i.e. declare the 
environment variables LIB and INCLUDE. For instance:\n
<tt>LIB=c:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 8/vc/lib;c:/Program Files/MicrosoftVisual Studio 8/vc/platformsdk/lib</tt>\n
<tt>INCLUDE=c:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 8/VC/include;c:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 8/VC/PlatformSDK/Include</tt>\n

To compile MTL4 programs (including the tests), it is advisable to use 
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
Go into the MTL4 main directory and run:\n\n
<tt>cmake .</tt>\n\n
Possibly, CMake will ask you to specify a generator "-G".
After you have run CMake, several project files will appear in this directory.

Click on "ALL_BUILD.vcproj" (or "ALL_BUILD.vcprojx") and Visual Studio will open
with a project folder containing all test and example programs.




\section optionalinstall Optional Installations


<b>Using BLAS:</b>
Dense %matrix multiplication has an acceleration with BLAS (when the types of the %matrix elements allow).
More BLAS usage is currently under development.
To use this acceleration install a well-tuned BLAS (the original Netlib BLAS was even slower than our
implementation when benchmarked it), preferably with a packet manager
and set the macro MTL_HAS_BLAS.
Although one can set the macro somewhere in the program sources it is recommended for better porting
to define it in the compiler, e.g.:\n
<tt>g++ -DMTL_HAS_BLAS -lblas ...</tt>\n
or\n
<tt>cl /DMTL_HAS_BLAS ...</tt>\n
Of course, the library must be linked as well.

<b>Using LAPACK:</b>
LAPACK is currently not supported but will be soon.


<b>Using UMFPACK:</b>
Programs that use UMFPACK must be compiled with MTL_HAS_UMFPACK
and linked with the UMFPACK library plus the libraries UMFPACK
depends on (AMD and UFConfig).

<b>Using Doxygen:</b>
The MTL4 documentation is available online.
If you like to create a copy on your computer, e.g. to read it when offline, you can create it yourself.
Just run <tt>doxygen</tt> in the main directory and you will find the documentation in <tt>libs/numeric/mtl/doc</tt>.
The HTML version is found in <tt>libs/numeric/mtl/doc/html</tt> and a PDF file in <tt>libs/numeric/mtl/doc/pdf</tt>
(not available online).
The revision number in the page footer is not automatically set.
In the main directory is a script <tt>mtl_doxygen</tt> that updates the footer.
Unfortunately, it does not work under Windows.
One can also 
generate man pages by enabling it in the Doxyfile (in MTL4's root directory).
Doxygen can be downloaded <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">here</a>.

\section Testing

To make sure that MTL4 is completely installed and properly working on your platform,
you can run the same tests as we use
in our development.
The whole test suite can be compiled and executed with few commands.
We recommend using cmake, see \subpage testing_cmake.
As legacy code there are still scons files that might possibly still work, see \subpage testing_scons.
Both build systems support Windows and one can use cmake to generate Visual Studion project folder containing all MTL4 tests and tutorial examples.
 
\section install_nutshell In a nutshell


Resuming, for MTL4 you need to:
- Install Boost and include its directory in the compiler flags (unless already in the include path);
- Install MTL4 and include its directory in the compiler flags (unless already in the include path);
- Optionally install cmake or scons (or both);
- Optionally install some or all of the libraries: BLAS, UMFPACK, and LAPACK; and
- Optionally install doxygen.

\section supported_compilers Supported compilers

The %Matrix Template Library is written in compliance with the C++ standard
and should be compilable with every compiler compliant with the standard.
It is regularly tested - <a href="http://www.simunova.com/en/node/33" target="_top">see here
for a list of compilers are tested nightly</a> and 
<a href="http://www.simunova.com/en/node/182" target="_top">here for the test results</a>.

More compilers will be tested in the future.

Compilers that are not standard-compliant (e.g. VC 6.0) are not subject to support.
Visual Studio is considered standard-compliant from VC 7.1 on but we still had trouble to compile MTL4
and even in VC 8.0 we needed a little work-around.


Proceed to the \ref debugger_support.

//-----------------------------------------------------------

//-----------------------------------------------------------
/*! 
\page debugger_support Debugger Support

We currently support gdb, DDD and <a href="http://www.allinea.com/ddt">Allinea DDT</a>.

<b>This requires gdb 7.0 or higher.</b> (This can be a problem on MacOS.)

Disclaimer: Since we used the implementation of STL container support (which is under GPL) we
put the debugger support under GPL as well to comply with the license rules.
As we separated this implementation from the rest of MTL4 it does not affect
the license regulations of the remainder of MTL4, in particular not the commercial editions.

\section debugger_installation Installation

-# Download the archive of the MTL printers from <a href="http://www.simunova.com/node/145">our web page</a>.
-# Decompress unzip gdb_printers.zip
-# Modify in your home directory the file .gdbinit as described below.

Your file <tt>$HOME/.gdbinit</tt> could read:

\include gdbinit_example.hpp 

In fact, you can copy this file to your home directory and replace <tt>/home/username/tools</tt> with the path
where you unzipped the archive <tt>gdb_printers.zip</tt>.

The support for STL containers is highly recommended for any up-to-date C++ programmer, 
see <a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/STLSupport">here for details</a>.

\section debugger_gdb gdb

In gdb you can simple write <tt>print v</tt> for any vector and <tt>print A</tt> for matrices. See for supported types below.

\section debugger_ddd Data Display Debugger

DDD can print data in the same manner as gdb but displaying them is of course more elegant:

\image html DDD.png

Vectors can be modified on the fly (you have to delete the type information in the input window).
Matrices will be modifiable in the future.

If you really want to see the complete information (even for us this is ugly),
you can type<br>
<tt>print /r A</tt><br> 
in the lower gdb window (the notation does not work in all gdb versions).


\section debugger_ddt Allinea Distributed Debugging Tool

This should work out of the box. We will add screenshots soon.

\section totalview_support Totalview Support

Might be added some day -- the interface for user types is less convenient.

\section debugger_types Supported Types

So far we have implemented:
- dense_vector
  - With dynamic size
  - With static size
  - Values can be modified
  .
- mat::dense2D
  - With dynamic size
  - With static size
  .
- mat::compressed2D
- mat::coordinate2D
- mat::ell_matrix
.

/*! 
\page testing_scons Testing with scons


Testing with scons is no longer supported.
However, the scons files are still present and might still work.
We nonetheless recommend using cmake.


If you want to run the test programs, you need the build system
<a href="http://www.scons.org">scons</a>.
It is easy to install and takes only a few minutes.
The scons-based build of MTL4 uses the environment variables 
<tt>MTL_BOOST_ROOT</tt> to locate the MTL directory
and <tt>BOOST_ROOT</tt> to locate the Boost directory.



To execute the test programs go in MTL4's test directory
libs/numeric/mtl/test and type:\n
<tt>scons -D . check=1</tt>\n
If the building finishes all tests were passed.
The building can be considerably speed up, esp. on multi-core processors,
when scons is used with multiple processes.
For instance, to run the tests with four processes (which works quite
well on two processors) type:\n
<tt>scons -Dj 4 . check=1</tt>\n
The output will be quite chaotic but, again, when the building finishes
all tests are passed.

Similarly, the example programs can be compiled.
Go in directory libs/numeric/mtl/examples and type:\n
<tt>scons -D .</tt>\n
For the sake of simplicity, there are no checks in the examples (nevertheless an exceptions
thrown in the examples help to fix a bug).

To compile (and test) all programs you can run scons in the main directory (then you do not
need the -D option and the dot) or in any directory of the tree if you use -D and omit the dot.
You can also compile single files if you specify the name of the executable (including .exe on
windows).

If you want to use BLAS, you need to define the macro <tt>MTL_HAS_BLAS</tt>,
e.g., by compiling your programs with 
<tt>-DMTL_HAS_BLAS</tt>, and link the appropriate libraries.
Alternatively, you can use MTL4's build system 
with the flag <tt>with-blas=1</tt> that will
check if GotoBlas, ACML, or ATLAS is installed on your system
(thanks to Torsten Hoefler who wrote the tests in scons).
If scons does not find your BLAS library you can specify additional
flags, see\n
<tt>scons -h</tt>\n
for details.

*/
//-----------------------------------------------------------



//-----------------------------------------------------------
/*! 
\page testing_cmake Testing with CMake


If you want to run the test programs, you will need the the
cross-platform, open-source and build system <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>. This tool is easy
to install, if you have Ubuntu, you can use the Synaptic Package
Manager to install it, or well typing\n\n
<tt>sudo apt-get install cmake</tt>\n\n
on the terminal.

CMake can compile all examples of MTL4 just typing\n\n
<tt>make</tt>\n\n
 in the directory with the examples, but if you want to doing that, you
must generate the makefiles  first.

\section cmake_preps Preparations:


-# Cmake uses one environment variable and that is BOOST_ROOT to locate the Boost directory.
   In bash for example, you can set it with the comand "export", e.g.:\n\n
    <tt>export BOOST_ROOT=/usr/include/boost</tt>\n\n
    Note: you can write that line in your file ~/.bashrc, to have it all the time.
    With csh or tcsh you need accordingly:\n\n
    <tt>setenv BOOST_ROOT /usr/include/boost</tt>\n\n
    which can be put into ~/.cshrc as well.
-# You need a C++ compiler, e.g. g++. On most Linux distributions, this is installed 
   by default. If not you can install it easily with a package manager.
   
\section test_running Running the Tests

There is a slight difference for MTL4 sources that are checked out with subversion and
those that are downloaded as package or archive.

\subsection test_running_svn Testing with Sources via subversion

Go to the directory of MTL4 and write on the terminal:\n\n
<tt>cmake .</tt> \n\n
to create all automatic files to compile the tests and examples of
MTL4.

After that, you can go to the directory "libs/numeric/mtl/tests"
or "libs/numeric/mtl/examples",
to write "make" and all tests/examples will be compiled.
Alternatively you can run "make" in MTL4's root directory to build
all tests and examples.

Lastly, run "ctest ." in the root or test directory to see if all
tests compute the expected results. (Running ctest on the examples works
fine; however, it has no effect since they do not check whether they yield the expected result.)

\subsection test_running_download Testing with downloaded Sources

We provide a CMake module named "MTLConfig.cmake" which resides in directory <prefix>/usr/share/mtl.
You can add this directory to your module path, e.g.:\n\n
<tt>setenv CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}:/usr/share/mtl</tt> \n\n
Alternatively you can define the environment variable "MTL_DIR", e.g.:\n\n
<tt>setenv MTL_DIR /usr/share/mtl</tt> \n\n

Then go to the directory <prefix>/usr/share/mtl/test and run\n\n
<tt>cmake .</tt> \n\n
If cmake fails to find all necessary libraries calln\n
<tt>ccmake .</tt> \n\n
or an according graphical tool and set the missing variables.

You can also add external software packages like BLAS or UMFPACK if you like to test the respective interfaces.

To build and run the tests go to directory <prefix>/usr/share/mtl/test and type\n\n
<tt>make\n
ctest .</tt> \n\n
You will see how many tests do not compile (test not run) or did not deliver the expected result (test failed).

In the same manner, one can check whether the examples compile and run by performing "make" and "ctest" in
directory <prefix>/usr/share/mtl/example.
Opposed to the tests, the examples do not check for expected outcome because they are intended for concise
illustration.
Including them in the standard test procedure ensures that all examples from the tutorial always compile and run
while the library evolves.

Experiences with IDEs are welcome and we would be happy to provide more help in the future.

Proceed to \ref tutorial "the tutorial".  

*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------
/*! \page winxp_eclipse32_gcc323 WinXP / Eclipse-3.2 CDT-3.1 / gcc-3

You should have some basic experience with Eclipse. So I won't explain
each step for downloading and installing Eclipse/CDT. 

Some informations about the used systems:
-# OS: WinXP SP2 with all updates (it's my business notebook, so 
   I can't do something against the updates  :-(   )
-# Compiler: MinGW32 with gcc-3.2.3
-# Eclipse-3.2
-# CDT-3.1.2

Some informations about the installation path:
-# MinGW32: is installed in c:/MinGW
-# Eclipse: is installed in c:/Programme/eclipse
-# CDT-3.1.2: will be installed automatically in the eclipse directory
-# MTL4/Boost: are installed in c:/cppLibs/mtl4 and in c:/cppLibs/boost_1_34_1

Now let's starting Eclipse. If Eclipse is started, change to the c++ perspective.
If this is the first time you can do it under:\n
<tt>Window/Open Persepctive/Other</tt>\n
Now chose \c c++ and the view will get a new look!

To show the configuration we will create a new project. Chose\n
<tt>File/New/Project.../Managed Make C++ Project</tt>\n
This will open a new dialog. Enter <tt>vector1</tt> as project name. I will change
the \c Location to <tt>u:/programming/vector1</tt>. To do this, click on the
check box, now you can push the \c Browse button. The next dialog will open. Chose
a path and in my case, the directory \c vector1 doesn't exist. So I have to
push the button <tt>new directory</tt> and enter the directory name \c vector1.
Now click \c Next.

Click \c Finish on the new dialog. The new project will be created and you can
see it on the left side in the \c Navigator or in the <tt>C/C++ Projects</tt> view.

Now let's copy the \c vector1.cpp of the mtl4 example in the new project directory.
Press \c F5 to update the C++ perspective. Maybe you have to push more than only once.
Java isn't so fast :-)\n
Now you can see the file \c vector1.cpp in the <tt>C/C++ Projects</tt> view.

Before we start with configuring this project, let's check your installation of
MinGW. Enter at the command prompt <tt>gcc --version</tt>. Now something similar
like <tt>gcc (GCC) 3.2.3 (mingw special....)</tt> should appear. Be sure that you 
don't have a second compiler in your path. Please don't install the MSYS package.
This will cause some problems during the linking process. If you get here an error,
please first fix this! Check your path variable and so on. Like the MSYS CYGWIN 
will also cause some problems. Remove the path entry, if you have installed CYGWIN!

Now mark with one left click your project in Eclipse. Than one right click to open 
a context menu. Go down to \c Properties and click again. <tt>Properties for vector1
</tt> dialog appears. Click on <tt>C/C++ Build</tt>. In this section, we will find 
all the necessaries properties we have to configure.

In <tt>Active configuration</tt> you can read \c Debug. For this simple example,
change it to \c Release.

Now in <tt>Configuration Settings / Tool Settings</tt> click on 
<tt>GCC C++ Compiler / Directories</tt>. Here we have to include the
directories of mtl4 and the boost library. We can do it with a click
on the icon with the green cross. In the new dialog, click on 
<tt>File system...</tt> and chose the mtl4 main directory and do the same 
for the boost library. So this property will contain two entries.
-# "C:\cppLibs\mtl4"
-# "C:\cppLibs\boost_1_34_1"
.
\n
in my case.

Now change to the tab <tt>Build Settings</tt>. Enter an artifact name and an
extension. For windows systems this should be \c exe . For artifact name you can
take \c vector1 .\n
Under <tt>Build command</tt> you have to enter <tt>mingw32-make -k</tt>.

So we can go to the next tab \c Environment. I have installed several compiler
vor AVM microcontrollers, CYGWIN and the MinGW. This step is necessary to compile
the example successfull, even though I removed all the compiler entries in the
path variable. Don't ask me why!\n
Click on the button \c New in the configuration section. A next dialog appears.
In the field \c Name enter \c path. In \c Value appears your path and in my
case in the front of all the cygwin installation. Now remove this and all
other compilers in this path (inside the value field). The field \c Delimiter
contains the correct sign. Let's change the \c Operation to \c Replace and
click on OK. So a new user variables appears. Click on apply and than on OK.

Now you can test it if you can compile this simple example. Otherwise, please 
restart Eclipse.

P.S.: The description how to use Eclipse is contributed by Michael Schmid
      and we are very grateful for his efforts.

It goes without saying that we will do our best that applications are minimally affected.
In particular, the topics in the tutorial are not subject to modifications.

/*! \page vector_def Vector Types

To start the tutorial, we want to give a very short example (we could call
it the MTL4-hello-world).

\include vector1.cpp

The <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost library</a>
is used and must also be downloaded. See the
\ref install "installation guide" for more details.
To compile a MTL4 program you only need to include the MTL and the
boost path.
A compile command could read:\n 
<tt>g++ -I/u/peter/mtl4 -I/u/peter/boost -O2 vector1.cpp -o vector1</tt>\n
As most modern C++ software MTL4 uses intensively function inlining.
As a consequence, the performance is rather poor if compiled without
optimization.
But don't worry: despite the aggressive source code transformation at 
compile time, the compilation rarely took more than a minute, in
most cases only a few seconds.

The short program certainly does not need much explanation only some
brief comments.
The %vector in the program above is a column %vector.
The constructor in the example takes two arguments: the size and the 
initial value.

Indices always start with zero.
Earlier efforts to support one-based indices were abandoned because
code became rather complicated when mixed indexing for different
arguments of a function.
We decided that the additional development
 effort and the potential performance
penalty are not acceptable.
Extra functionality will be provided in the future if necessary for 
interoperability with Fortran libraries.

The following program defines a row %vector of 7 elements without 
(explicit) initialization.

\include vector2.cpp

Scalar values can be assigned to vectors if the type of the scalar
value is assignable to the type of the elements.
Scalar types are in MTL4 all types that are not explicitly defined
by type %traits as vectors or matrices, thus almost all types.

All vectors have free functions for the number of rows and columns
and the  size.

To find out the number of rows use
\code
  unsigned r= num_rows(v);
\endcode
It returns an unsigned integer (more precisely the size_type of the %vector type).
The result is the number of elements for a column %vector and 1 for 
a row %vector.

Likewise the number of columns is given
\code
  unsigned c= num_cols(v);
\endcode
The result is the number of elements for a row %vector and 1 for 
a column %vector.
The size is given by the function size
\code
  unsigned s= size(v);
  assert (s == r * c);
\endcode
and is the number of elements.
This is equal to the product of the numbers of rows and columns.  
These definitions are consistent with the according functions for matrices (\ref matrix_types).

*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page matrix_types Matrix Types



Right now, MTL4 provides five %matrix types:
- \ref mat::dense2D;
- \ref mat::morton_dense; 
- \ref mat::compressed2D; and
- multi_vector, see \ref multivector
- element_structure.

The type \ref mat::dense2D defines regular 
row-major and column-major matrices:

\include dense2D.cpp

If no %matrix parameters are defined, dense matrices are
by default row-major.
There are more %matrix parameters besides the orientation.
As they are not yet fully supported we refrain from discussing
them.

%Matrix elements can be accessed by a(i, j) or in the more
familiar form a[i][j].
The second form is internally transformed into the first
one at compile time so that the run-time performance is not
affected (unless the compiler does not inline completely
which we never observed so far).
Also, the compile time is not conceivably increased by this
transformation.

Please notice that overwriting single %matrix elements is only
defined for dense %matrix types. 
For a generic way to modify matrices see \ref matrix_insertion.

\section assing_scalars Assigning Scalar Values to Matrices

Assigning a scalar value to a %matrix stores a multiple of
the identity %matrix, i.e. the scalar is assigned to all
diagonal elements and all off-diagonal elements are 0.
Diagonal elements are %matrix entries with identical row and column index.
Therefore scalars can also be assigned to non-square matrices.
This %operation is generic (i.e. applicable to
all %matrix types including sparse).

Just in case you wonder why the %scalar value is only assigned to the diagonal
elements of the %matrix not to all entries, this becomes quite clear
when you think of a %matrix as a linear operator (from one %vector space
to another one).
For instance, consider the multiplication of %vector x with the scalar alpha:
\code
    y= alpha * x;
\endcode
where y is a %vector, too.
This %operation is equivalent to assigning alpha to the %matrix A and multiplying x with 
A:
\code
    A= alpha;
    y= A * x;
\endcode
In other words, the %matrix A has the same impact on x as the scalar alpha itself.

If the %matrix is not square, i.e. the linear operator's domain and image have different
dimensions, the equivalence with the scalar multiplication applies accordingly.
In case that the image has a lower dimension, say m, then only the first m entries of the
vector from the domain are scaled with alpha and the others are ignored.
If the image has an higher dimension then the last m-n entries are zero with
n the dimension of the domain.
When you rely on this behavior please check the revision of your MTL4 library:
old versions, i.e. before revision 6843, considered it erroneous to store
 a non-zero scalar to a non-square %matrix.

From a more pragmatic prospective:
\code
    A= 0; 
\endcode
can be used to clear any %matrix, square or rectangular, sparse and dense. 

\section morton_intro Recursive Memory Layout

Dense matrices with a recursively designed memory layout
can be defined with the type \ref mat::morton_dense :

\include morton_dense.cpp

In the pure Morton order format 2 by 2 sub-matrices are stored contiguously in memory.
4 by 4 matrices constitute of 4 2-by-2-matrices and use consecutive memory.
The continuation of this recursive scheme provides square sub-matrices with power of two
sizes that are in contiguous memory and allow for cache-efficient recursive algorithms.
On the other hand, algorithms that are implemented fully recursively create considerable
overhead for function calls.
We therefore recommend using mixed schemes of %recursion and iteration. 
Particularly efficient are algorithms that operate on mid-size blocks, e.g. 64 by 64,
with regular row-major or column-major layout.
MTL4 provides a virtually infinite number of memory layouts for dense matrices
that are specified by a bitmask.
A detailed description and discussion of recursive matrices and algorithm is
provided in 
<a href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/~pgottsch/ics07.pdf">this conference paper</a>.

Sparse matrices are defined with the type \ref mat::compressed2D :

\section compressed_intro Compressed Sparse Matrices

\include compressed2D.cpp

%Matrix a is stored as compressed row storage (CRS).
Its assigned values correspond to a discretized Laplace operator.
To change or insert single elements of a compressed %matrix
is not supported.
Especially for very large matrices, this would result in an
unbearable performance burden.

However, it is allowed to %assign a scalar value to the entire %matrix
given it is square as in the example.
%Matrix b is stored in compressed column storage (CCS).

Which orientation is favorable dependents on the performed
%operations and might require some experimentation.
All %operations are provided in the same way for both formats

All matrices have free functions for the number of rows and columns
and the %matrix size, which is understood as the product of the former
and not the number of non-zeros.

To find out the number of rows use
\code
  unsigned r= num_rows(A);
\endcode
It returns an unsigned integer (more precisely the size_type of the %matrix type).
Likewise the number of columns is given
\code
  unsigned c= num_cols(A);
\endcode
The %matrix size is given by
\code
  unsigned s= size(A);
  assert (s == r * c);
\endcode
and is defined as product of the numbers of rows and columns.  
These definitions are consistent with the according functions for vectors (\ref vector_def).

\section matrix_parameters Matrix Parameters

The matrices can take a second (in case of mat::morton_dense a third)
template argument that allows for certain specialization.
The argument should be an instance of the template class mat::parameters.
There are the following arguments:
- Orientation: whether the matrix is row_major or column-major (col_major), diagonal orientation might be added later, default is row_major;
- Index: was intended for easier handling of 1-based Fortran-like indexing but turned out to be too error-prone and unreadable in a generic context; might be removed in the future;
- Dimensions: non_fixed::dimensions for giving the dimension at run time or fixed::dimensions to specify during compilation, default is non_fixed::dimensions;
- OnStack: whether data should be stored on stack or on heap; storage on stack requires fixed::dimensions (although some compilers like g++ also support arrays with run-time sizes which is not standard-compliant); default is true for static dimensions and false otherwise;
- SizeType: the type for storing indices; default is std::size_t.


Some arguments in certain %matrix types or have little impact, for instance:
- Orientation is ignored in mat::morton_dense since the layout is determined by the mask;
- OnStack is ignored in mat::compressed2D and fixed::dimensions reduce the overall memory need only marginally;
- Reversely, the choice of SizeType has no effect on the performance of dense matrices are very little on their memory requirements.
.
Using only 32 bit integers instead of 64 bit can accelerate sparse matrix operations significantly because twice as much indices can be loaded from memory at the same time (and as we all know, memory bandwidth is the limiting factor in sparse algebra),
see \ref tuning_size_type.
Multiple operations are specialized for dense matrices with fixed dimensions, see \ref tuning_fsize.


\section matrix_insertion_ref Matrix Insertion

How to fill  sparse matrices is shown on page \ref matrix_insertion.

\section element_structure Element structure (advanced)

As a new matrix type, we have an element structure.
The use of this new structure is to be explained with the following 2 by 3 grid.

\image html 2by3grid.png

\include element_structure_example.cpp

This matrix type is very powerful for specific algorithms like the IMF-preconditioner but it is not suited
for beginners.

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page type_generator Type Generator


The type generator offers a simple and efficient way to declare vectors and matrices.
It requires the presence of multiple C++11 features which shows up in the examples as explicit test (see also \ref cppeleven_intro).
If you always define those macros in your build system than you can omit these ugly preprocessor tests
 (and your programs look nicer than our 
backward-compatible examples).
Thanks to variadic templates the number of template parameters is unlimited and the compile time is not wasted by dummy arguments.
The template aliases allow us to dispense the annoying "typename ::type" notation.
Here is an example with a variety of matrix types:

\include matrix1.cpp

There are more examples later in this section.
The idea of the type generator is to define the properties you really care about and 
let MTL4 choose appropriate defaults for the remaining ones.
Properties are declared by tags; these are empty types that only serve to differentiate types.


\section type_generator_simple_dense A Simple Dense Matrix

The value type is mandatory but all other arguments are optional.
For matrix A, we only provided the type of the elements.
In this case, the matrix is dense (\ref mat::dense2D).
The other properties are default values in the type generator.
That defaults are:
- Row-major orientation;
- Allocation on the heap;
- Size provided at run time; and
- Indices and sizes are size_t.
.
We reserve the right to change these defaults  in the future if there are really good reasons to do so.
However, this is very unlikely and will be announced upfront on the mailing list.
It is possible to explicitly declare a matrix as dense:
\code
    matrix<double, dense> A(2, 2);
\endcode

\section type_generator_simple_sparse A Sparse Matrix

Matrix B is an appropriate sparse matrix.
The actually generated matrix type depends on the platform.
On a CPU, the default is a compressed matrix (\ref mat::compressed2D)
and on a GPU it will be an ELLPACK matrix (\ref mat::ellpack).
In section \ref type_generator_sparse, we present the generation of
 the variety of sparse matrices that are currently available in MTL4.
The motivation of this choice is that matrix vector multiplication (MVP) is typically the most important operation for
sparse matrices and we therefor choose the type with the fastest MVP on the platform.
Here the remaining type parameters are defaults (row-major orientation, heap-allocated with run-time size and size_t for indexing).


\section type_generator_col_major Column-major Matrices

Matrices C and D are column-major matrices.
The sparse matrix C is by default on a CPU a Compressed Column-Storage (CCS) matrix.
The dense matrix D is like a Fortran matrix with 0-based indexing.
For convenience, we provided two aliases: mtl::col_major and mtl::column_major.
There is absolutely no difference between the two; the first tag already existed before
and is kept for consistency and the second tag was introduced because it looks nicer.

\section type_generator_size_type Choosing the Size Type

Matrix E is a sparse matrix where all indices are stored as int.
On typical 64-bit platforms int and unsigned are 4 byte long in contrast to size_t that is 8 byte 
(otherwise indices would not cover the address space).
Storing indices in 4 instead of 8 byte can safe a lot of memory and what is usually more
important a lot of memory traffic.
Assuming the 4 byte length, int allows for matrices with two billion and unsigned for four billion entries.
This is often large enough and the reduced memory traffic creates a considerable performance boost.

Remark: In the parallel MTL4, distributed matrices can have up to 4 billion entries per MPI process with unsigned
indices (whereas global indices are always size_t or long int so that the global size is only limited by memory). 

Dense matrices can also be declared with shorter index types.
However, this has no impact on the performance since the memory size and traffic is not significantly reduced unless the matrix is very small.
However, for tiny dense matrices it is better to provide the size at compile time if already known, see \ref type_generator_fixed_size.

Especially, when the size type is the only parameter that you want to set, the type generator comes in quite handy
since the size type is the last parameter of mat::parameters so that all parameters must be declared even those with default values.
The declaration of matrix E without type generator is:
\code
    compressed2D<float, mat::parameters<row_major, mtl::index::c_index, non_fixed::dimensions, false, int> E(2, 2);
\endcode

\section type_generator_fixed_size Fixed-size Matrices

In the example above, the size of matrix F is given at compile time.
The tag \ref dim is a variadic template allowing for an arbitrary number of values of std::size_t.
In the case of a matrix type, there must be evidently exact two numbers, everything else is an error.
A compile-time size implies that the matrix data is stored directly in the object on the stack.
If you want to store the data on the heap  you have to declare the tag \ref on_heap as well.
Data on the stack is usually faster.
On the other hand, heap data allows for move semantics and is not limited in size (except for the total memory size).
Loop unrolling is performed in both cases regardless of the memory location.
Compile-time sizes can be provided for sparse matrices as well but this does not make really sense, does it?

\section type_generator_sparse Sparse Matrix Types

The following example program shows the variety of sparse matrices in MTL4 and their respective generation:

\include matrix2.cpp

Matrix A is a compressed sparse matrix.
In contrast to tag "\ref sparse",
the tag "\ref compressed" assures that this matrix has always type \ref mat::compressed2D regardless of the target platform.

The compressed layout implies that the matrix is sparse.
But if you like, you can declare both \ref sparse and \ref compressed, e.g.:
\code
    matrix<float, sparse, compressed>         A(2, 2);
\endcode
On the other hand, asking for a dense compressed matrix will cause an error, see \ref type_generator_errors.
The same applies for most other sparse matrix types in this section (see remark about \ref banded matrices below).

The other sparse matrices in the example have the following types:
- B: \ref mat::sparse_banded;
- C: \ref mat::ell_matrix;
- D: \ref mat::coordinate2D;
.
More sparse matrix types will be implemented.

We also plan a format for dense banded matrices, i.e. matrices where a continuous interval of bands is stored
as opposed to sparse banded matrices where arbitrary bands can be stored.
Right now, only the latter is available so that \ref banded currently implies \ref sparse.
This will change when dense banded matrices are realized (then \ref banded without sparsity attribute means
densely banded).
To prevent this type change, we added the \ref sparse attribute in B's declaration.


\section type_generator_morton Morton-order Matrices

Matrices with a recursive dense layout -- confer \ref morton_intro -- can be declared with the \ref morton tag.
If no mask is given like for E, the default is a mirror-inverted N (i.e. a Cyrillic I).
For matrix F, the mask is given which implies that the matrix has Morton-order. 

\section type_generator_generator Vectors

Vector types can be generated like-wise:

\include vector.cpp

After knowing the generation of matrix types the program above is self-explanatory.
The only noticeable difference is that the default orientation is column-major as column vectors are much more 
often used than row vectors.
Just as confirmation:
- v1 is a column-major, dense, with run-time size and allocated on the heap.
- v2 is a row-major, dense, with run-time size and allocated on the heap.
- v3 is a column-major, dense, with compile-time size and allocated on the stack.


\section type_generator_default Default Parameters

In general, we do not want to declare default parameters for the sake of conciseness. 
There might be two reasons for doing it: documentation and prevention from the very unlikely case of changing defaults.
The following tags assure the defaults:
- \ref dense to assure the matrix is dense;
- \ref compressed in the sparse case to assure that the matrix type is \ref mat::compressed2D;
- \ref row_major to ascertain row-major orientation of matrices;
- \ref column_major (or \ref col_major) to ascertain column vectors;
- \ref on_heap to guarantee heap allocation (stack allocation only possible with fixed sizes);
- \ref as_size_type<size_t> to assure that indices and sizes are treated as size_t.
The only default that cannot be declared explicitly is run-time size.

\section type_generator_errors Consistency and Error Messages

The type generator verifies the passed parameters and emits an informative error message if there is a conflict, e.g.:
- \ref dense with \ref compressed, \ref banded, \ref ellpack, or \ref coordinate;
- \ref sparse with \ref morton;
- Multiple layout \ref mask with \ref morton order matrices;
- Multiple layouts; or
- \ref on_stack allocation without \ref dim
The error message is only printed when static_assert is support and enabled by the presence of MTL_WITH_STATICASSERT.
Otherwise, only the location of the failed test is provided.

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page multivector Type Multivector


A multi-vector is an abstraction that is very useful in Krylov subspace methods, esp.
when they are implemented generically.
It is a %matrix that composed of column vectors.
The simplest use case is to just store multiple vectors of the same length.
Especially the %matrix %vector product including its transposed form allow for well-readable
implementations of algorithms like GMRES and for straight-forward extension to distributed
vectors.

To create a multi-vector, there are two ways:
-# Constructor by number of rows and columns: 
\code
	mtl::multi_vector<Vector> 	A(2, 3);
\endcode
-# Constructor by number of rows and column %vector for initialization
\code
	mtl::multi_vector<Vector>	A(Vector(3), 2);
\endcode
In the first method, you get a %matrix which has 2 rows and 3 columns.
This constructor with number of rows and columns exist for all %matrix types and is important for 
generic creation.

In the 2nd method, you get a %matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns.
Remark: in older versions, before revision 6957, the arguments were reversed.

To find out the number of rows use
\code
  unsigned r= num_rows(A);
\endcode
It returns an unsigned integer (more precisely the size_type of the %vector type).
Likewise the number of columns is given
\code
  unsigned c= num_cols(A);
\endcode

To modify individual entries of the multi-vector, there are several possibilities. 
You can write a %vector (same length) in the k-th column of the multi-vector, and vice versa.
\code
	mtl::multi_vector<Vector> 	A(2, 3);
	Vector				v(2), w(2);
	A.vector(k)= v;
	v= A.vector(k);
\endcode
You can also specify the row and column of the entry to be changed.
\code
	A[1][1]= 3.5;
\endcode

\section ops_multi_vector Operations with multi-vectors

On the one hand we can consider a multi-vector as a collection of vectors, on the other hand as a %matrix.
Thus, there are many multi-vector %operations.
\include multi_vector.cpp

The multi-vector is a %matrix, therefore the following %matrix 
%operations are defined: trace(A), conj(A), trans(A), hermitian(A).
The interface is nevertheless minimalistic and not the same functionality as for other %matrix types is provided.
More functions will be implemented when needed.

/*! \page matrix_insertion Matrix Insertion

Setting the values of a dense %matrix is an easy task since each element
has its dedicated location in memory.
Setting sparse matrices, esp. compressed ones, is a little more complicated.
There exist two extreme approaches:
- Inserting all values on the fly at any time; or
- Providing a special insertion phase and then creating the compressed format
  once and forever.

The former approach has the advantage that it is handier and that the set-up
of sparse matrices can be handled like dense matrices (which eases the development
of generic code).
However, when matrices grow larger, the insertion becomes more and more expensive,
up to the point  of being unusable.
Most high-performance libraries use therefore the second approach.
In practice, a sparse %matrix is usually the result of discretization (FEM, FDM, ...)
that is set up once and then used many times in linear or non-linear solvers.
Many libraries even establish a two-phase set-up: first building the sparsity pattern
and then populating the non-zero elements with values.

The MTL4 approach lies somewhere between.
Sparse matrices can be either written (inserted) or read.
However, there can be multiple insertion phases.

\section element_insertion Element-wise Insertion

Before giving more details, we want to show you a short example:

\include insert.cpp

The first aspect worth pointing at is that sparse and dense matrices are treated
the same way.
If we cannot handle sparse matrices like dense (at least not efficiently), we
can treat dense matrices like sparse ones.
For performance reasons, matrices are not initialized by default. 
Therefore, the first operation in the function fill is to set the %matrix to zero.


Internally the inserters for dense and sparse matrices are implemented completely
differently but the interface is the same.
Dense inserters insert the value directly and there is not much to say about.

Sparse inserters are more complicated.
The constructor stretches the %matrix so that the first five elements in a row
(in a CCS %matrix likewise the first 5 elements in a column) are inserted directly.
During the live time of the inserter, new elements are written directly into
empty slots. 
If all slots of a row (or column) are filled, new elements are written into an std::map.
During the entire insertion process, no data is shifted.

If an element is inserted twice then the existing element is overwritten, regardless
if the element is stored in the %matrix itself or in the overflow container.
Overwriting is only the default. The function modify() illustrates how to use the inserter
incrementally.
Existing elements are incremented by the new value.
We hope that this ability facilitates the development of FEM code.

For performance reasons it is advisable to customize the number of elements per row (or column),
e.g., ins(m, 13).
Reason being, the overflow container consumes  more memory per element then the 
regular %matrix container.
In most applications, an upper limit can be easily given.
However, the limit is not that strict: if some rows need more memory than the slot size it only
results in slightly higher memory need for the overflow container.
If the number of elements per row is very irregular we recommend a slot size over the average
(and maybe under the maximum).
Since only a small part of the data is  copied during the compression, sparse matrices 
can be created that fill almost the entire memory.

Nota bene: inserters for dense matrices are not much more than facades for the matrices themselves
in order to provide the same interface as for sparse ones.
However, dense inserters can be also very useful in the future for extending the 
library to parallel computations.
Then the inserter can be used to write values into remote %matrix elements.

\section destroy_inserter INSERTERS MUST BE DESTROYED

A mistake that many people did with inserters was using the matrix before the inserter
was destroyed, e.g.:
\code
using namespace mtl;
typedef compressed2D<double> matrix_type;

matrix_type A(5, 5);
mat::inserter<matrix_type> ins(A);
ins[0][0] << 7.3; // .... more insertions

do_something_with(A);  // TROUBLE!!!
\endcode
Then the matrix A is not ready and an exception is thrown (or an assertion fails depending on
compile flags).

The issue was apparently not sufficiently discussed in the tutorial and 
we have to blamed not the users for doing this wrong.


The insertion problem is circumvented by defining the inserter in a separate function
as we did in the \ref element_insertion "previous section".
If we accessed the matrix within the fill-in function 
we would experience the same problem.

If no separate function shall be defined for brevity, one can define the
inserter in an extra block.
The following program implements the function "fill" of the example insert.cpp
with a compressed matrix:

\include insert_scope.cpp

Alternatively, one can handle the insertion destruction explicitly with pointer
as will be explained \ref multiple_insertion "later".

\section block_insertion Block-wise Insertion

A more powerful method to fill sparse (and dense) matrices provide the two functions
element_matrix() and element_array().

The following program illustrates how to use them:

\include element_matrix.cpp

The function element_array is designed for element matrices that are stored as 
a 2D C/C++ array.
The entries of such an element %matrix are accessed by A[i][j],
while the entries are accessed by A(i, j) if the function element_matrix is used.
Element matrices stored in MTL4 types can be accessed both ways and either
element_array or element_matrix can be used.

Both functions can be called with two or three arguments.
In the former case the first argument is the element %matrix and the second argument
a %vector containing the indices that correspond to the rows and columns of the
assembled %matrix.
With three arguments, the second one is a %vector of row indices and the third one
a %vector with column indices.
Evidently, the size of the %vector with the row/column indices should be equal to the
number of rows/columns of the element %matrix.

The %vector type must provide a member function size and a bracket operator.
Thus, mtl::dense_vector and std::vector can used (are models).

\section multiple_insertion Insertion in Multiple Function calls

If a matrix is set up by means of multiple function calls as it happens often
in finite element assembly.
Say we have a class world_matrix that contains a compressed matrix which is
set by calling add_entry several times.
We can define an inserter in the function add_entry and the inserter will be
destroyed after leaving the function:

\include insert_class_expensive.cpp

This works correctly but it is horribly slow because every value inserted need the 
creation of an inserter which is extremely expensive.

Defining an inserter as member of the class does not work at all because
the inserter will live as long as the containing object and the matrix
cannot be accessed during its life time.

The solution is to define a <b>pointer to an inserter as member</b>.
The pointer lives as long as the object and the life time of the referred inserter
can be controlled manually with new and delete.
This said, we need a function that allocates the pointer that must be called
before starting the insertion.
Accordingly, a function is required that deallocates the pointer so that
the inserter is destroyed.
This function must be called after terminating the insertion phase and before
accessing the matrix:

\include insert_class.cpp

Note that "ins" must be dereferred in add_entry.
We find this approach more error-prone than defining the inserter in an
extra scope but im some situations this is the only feasible way.

This approach is used in several software projects such as
<a href="http://www.simunova.com/node/17" target="new">AMDiS</a>
and
<a href="http://www.fenicsproject.org/" target="new">FEniCS</a>.

\section init_from_array Initializing Matrices with Arrays

For small matrices in examples it is more convenient to initialize the %matrix from a 2D C/C++ array
instead of filling it element-wise:

\include array_initialization.cpp

C/C++ arrays can be initialized be nested lists.
All MTL4 %matrices provide construction from arrays.
Unfortunately, it is not (yet) possible to initialize user-defined types with lists.
This is proposed for the next C++ standard and we will incorporate this feature 
as soon as it is generally available.

\section matrix_insertion_rational Rational

The template class mat::inserter is specialized for mat::compressed2D (and might be as well for other
classes later).
The specialization inherits its functionality from mat::compressed2D_inserter.

/*! \page vector_assignment Vector Assignment


Vectors assignments are in most cases performed by expression templated 
(see \ref vector_expr).

\section vector_assignment_rational Rational

Functions that return vectors may benefit from move semantics (\ref move_semantics).
Although the move semantics minimizes the number of copy operations,
performance analysis has shown that its emulation often slows down applications.
The reason is that vectors are rarely returned as objects but usually results
are directly assigned to its targets by means of expression templates.
On the other hand, if a non-rvalue vector (i.e. not being a function result) 
is assigned then the move semantic emulation creates a new vector.
The effort for the copy is still the same as with regular assignments but the creation
of the new vector has significant impact on the run time: the allocation and
deallocation uses a perceivable amount of time and the freshly allocated memory is
not as fastly accessible than the old one.
It can cause more cash misses, respectively TLB misses.
In worst case the physical memory might be exhausted and the application starts
swapping to virtual memory.

As a consequence we disabled move semantics emulation.
It can be enabled by the macro
\code
MTL_VECTOR_MOVE_EMULATION
\endcode
as compile flag or in the sources.
In the future, we will provide move semantics from C++11 which
does not have the negative side effect of additional memory allocation and
using cold memory.

/*! \page matrix_assignment Matrix Assignment

Assignment of matrices verifies the dimensions, i.e.
\code
A= B;
\endcode
is only correct when A and B have the same number of rows and columns.
If you need for some (probably avoidable) reason need to assign matrices of 
different dimension you must explicitly change it:
\code
A.change_dim(num_rows(B), num_cols(B));
A= B;
\endcode
We strongly recommend to avoid this because you risk to hide errors in your program.
Assigning matrices of different dimension is in most cases an indication for an error.
If memory consumption is the reason for such an assignment you should try to destroy unused
matrices (e.g. by introducing additional blocks and define matrices within) and define
new ones.

\section stem_cells Matrix Stem Cells

There is one exception that allows for the change of dimension, when the target has 
dimension 0 by 0.
These matrices are considered as stem cells, they can become whatever desired but 
once they get a non-trivial dimensionality they obey algebraic compatibility rules.
Default constructors of %matrix types always create 0 by 0 matrices.
This simplifies the implementation of generic setter function:
\code
dense2D<double> A;
some_setter(A);
\endcode

\section move_semantics Move Semantics

For numeric reliability we refrain from shallow copy semantics, cf. \ref shallow_copy_problems.
There is an important exception that covers most
algorithmically interesting cases where
shallow copies are legitimate.
Resulting objects of functions and operators exist only once and are
destroyed after assignments.
In the C++ community such arguments that can only appear on the
right-hand side of an assignment are called rvalue.
Rvalues that own their data can be copied shallowly without affecting the semantics.
David Abrahams et al. formalized this approach and implemented
the move library in the 
<a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/group__move__related.html">Adobe Source Libraries (ASL)</a>.

MTL4 uses move semantics to assign matrices of the same type when the source is an rvalue.
Therefore, returning matrices (or vectors) in functions is rather cheap if the target has the same type, e.g.:

\include move_matrix.cpp

Assigning expressions to matrices or vectors does not use move semantics because MTL4 operators are implemented
with expression templates and avoid unnecessary copies with other techniques.
We assume that carefully designed algorithms use assignments of variables to copy their contents and that
after changing one of the two variables the other still have the same value.
\code 
x= y;
y= z;  // x has still the same value as before this operation
\endcode
Resuming this, you can (and should) take an algorithm from a text book, 
implement it with the same operators and functions using MTL4
- Without fearing aliasing effects; and
- Without unnecessary copies.

Please not that move semantics relies on compiler-intern optimizations that some
compilers do not perform without optimization flags, e.g. MSVC.
Therefore, the tests for move semantics are not in the regular test directory
but in another one where the compilation uses optimization flags.
On MSVC we noticed that for higher optimization some locations were equal that
should not.
This could be worked around by inserting print-outs of pointers.
(Nevertheless this is not satisfying and help would be welcome.)

Last but not least, we want to thank David Abrahams and Sean Parent who helped 
to understand the subtle interplay between details of the implementation and
the behavior of the compiler.

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page vector_expr Vector Expressions

The following program illustrates the usage of basic %vector
expressions.

\include vector_expr.cpp

The mathematical definition of %vector spaces requires that
vectors can be added, multiplied with scalar values
and the results can be assigned to vectors.
In MTL4, the vectors must have the same algebraic shape, 
see \ref ashape,
 for addition
and assignment, i.e. column vectors cannot be assigned to row vectors.
If the elements of the vectors are vectors themselves or matrices
then the elements must also be of the same algebraic shape.

Products of scalars and vectors are
 implemented by a view, see \ref scaled_view,
and %vector elements are multiplied with the factor when
accessing an element of the view.
Please notice that the scaling factor's type is not required to be
identical with the vector's value type.
Furthermore, the value type of the view can be different from
the %vector's value type if necessary to represent the products.
The command is an example for it: multiplying a double %vector
with a complex number requires a complex %vector view to 
guarantee the correctness of the results.

Traditional definitions of operators perform computations
in temporary variables that are returned at the end of the
calculation.
The presence of multiple operators, say n, in a single expression
(which is always the case except for an assignment without numerics)
requires then the execution of n loops (possibly more to copy
the temporaries on the stack).
If the vectors are too large for the cache, values must be loaded
repeatedly from slower memories.
Expression templates circumvent this repeated loading of %vector
elements by
performing only one loop.

//-----------------------------------------------------------


/*! \page rich_vector_expr Rich Vector Expressions

As discussed in the previous chapter, 
%vector operation can be accelerated by improving
their cache locality via expression templates.
Cache locality can be further improved in applications
when subsequent %vector expressions are evaluated
in one loop, data dependencies allowing.
Unfortunately, this so-called loop fusion cannot be 
realized with expression templates.
At least not when the loops are performed in the assignment.

In collaboration with Karl Meerbergen, we developed expression
templates that can be nested, called rich expression templates.
The following program shows some examples of rich expression
templates:

\include rich_vector_expr.cpp

The first example shows the combination of an incremental
assignment with a %vector addition.
The second statement fuses four %vector expressions:
-# The value 2 is assigned to every element of x;
-# w is scaled in-place with 3;
-# v is incremented by the sum of both %vector; and
-# u is incremented by the new value of v.

Again, all these %operations are performed in one loop and each %vector
element is accessed exactly once.

The following program illustrates how to add matrices, including scaled matrices:

\include matrix_addition.cpp

The example shows that arbitrary combinations of matrices can be added, regardless their
orientation, recursive or non-recursive memory layout, and sparseness.

%Matrix multiplication can be implemented as elegantly:


\include matrix_mult_simple.cpp

Arbitrary %matrix types can be multiplied in MTL4.
Let's start with the operation that is the holy grail in 
high-performance computing:
dense %matrix multiplication.
This is also the operation shown in the example above.
The multiplication  can be executed with the function mult
where the first two arguments are the operands and the third the result.
Exactly the same is performed with the operator notation below.

Warning: the arguments and the result must be different!
Expressions like A= A*B will throw an exception.
More subtle aliasing, e.g., partial overlap of the matrices
might not be detected and result in undefined mathematical behavior.

Products of three matrices are supported now.
Internally they are realized by binary products creating temporaries
(thus, sequences of two-term products should provide better performance). 
Moreover, products can be arbitrarily added and subtracted:

//-----------------------------------------------------------


/*! \page matrix_vector_expr Matrix-Vector Expressions


%Matrix-vector products are written in the natural way:

\include matrix_vector_mult.cpp

The example shows that sparse and dense matrices can be multiplied
with vectors.
For the sake of performance, the products are implemented with 
different algorithms.
The multiplication of Morton-ordered matrices with vectors is
supported but currently not efficient.

As all products the result of a %matrix-vector multiplication can be 
 -# Directly assigned;
 -# Incrementally assigned; or
 -# Decrementally assigned (not shown in the example).
.
to a %vector variable.

Warning: the %vector argument and the result must be different!
Expressions like v= A*v will throw an exception.
More subtle aliasing, e.g., partial overlap of the %vectors
might not be detected and result in undefined mathematical behavior.

%Matrix-vector products (MVP) can be combined with other %vector
operations.
The library now supports expressions like
\code
r= b - A*x.
\endcode

Also supported is scaling of arguments, as well for the %matrix
as for the %vector:

\include scaled_matrix_vector_mult.cpp

All three expressions and the following block
compute the same result.
The first two versions are equivalent: %matrix elements are more numerous
but only used once while %vector elements are less in number but accessed more
often in the operation.
In both cases nnz additional multiplications are performed where nnz is the
number of non-zeros in A.
One can easily see that the third expressions adds 2 nnz operations, 
obviously much less efficient.

Under the assumption that n is smaller than nnz,
clearly less operations are required when the %matrix %vector product is
performed without scaling and the result is scaled afterward.
However, on most computer MVP is memory bandwidth limited and most likely
the additional sweep costs more time than the scaling in the expressions
above.
With the strong bandwidth limitation in MVP, the scaling in the three
expression will not be perceived for most large vectors (it will be done while
waiting anyway for data from memory).

/*! \page vector_norms Vector Norms


Principal MTL4 functions are all defined in namespace mtl.
Helper functions are defined in sub-namespaces to avoid
namespace pollution.

The following program shows how to compute norms:

\include vector_norm.cpp

Since this code is almost self-explanatory, we give only a few
comments here.
The definitions of the \ref one_norm, \ref two_norm, and 
\ref infinity_norm can
be found in their respective documentations.
%Vector norms are for performance reasons computed with unrolled loops.
Since we do not want to rely on the compilers' capability and 
in order to have more control over the optimization, the unrolling
is realized by meta-programming.
Specializations for certain compilers might be added later
if there is a considerable performance gain over the meta-programming
solution.

Loops in reduction %operations, like norms, are by default unrolled
to 8 statements.
The optimal unrolling depends on several factors, in particular
the number of registers and the value type of the %vector.
The last statement shows how to unroll the computation to six
statements.
The maximum for unrolling is 8 (it might be increased later).

The norms return the magnitude type of the vectors' value type, 
see Magnitude.

As %vector reductions base on the same implementation as norms, the
unrolling can be explicitly controlled as shown in the last
command.
The results of these reductions are the value type of the %vector.

\include vector_min_max.cpp

The dot product of two vectors is computed with the function \ref dot :

\include dot_example.cpp

As the previous computation the evaluation is unrolled, either with
a user-defined parameter or by default eight times.

The result type of \ref dot is of type of the values' product.
If MTL4 is compiled with a concept-compiler, the result type is 
taken from the concept std::Multiple and without concepts
Joel de Guzman's result type deduction from Boost is used.

In the dot function the first vector is conjugated (when complex).
There exist also definitions with the conjugation of the second vector
(e.g. the

/*! \page permutation Permutations, Reordering, and Matrix Indirection

\section Permutation

The following example shows how to use permutations:

\include permutation.cpp

The function mat::permutation returns a sparse %matrix computed from a permutation %vector.
The permutation %vector is defined as where entries come from, i.e. v[i] == j means that the 
i-th entry/row/column after the permutation was the j-th entry/row/column before the permutation.
If your %vector is defined in the inverse manner -- i.e. i.e. v[i] == j signifies that the 
i-th entry/row/column before the permutation becomes the j-th entry/row/column after the permutation --
your permutation %matrix is the transposed of what MTL4 computes: P= trans(mat::permutation(v)).

\section Reordering

Reordering is a generalization of permutation.
The entries in the reorder %vector/array are defined in the same fashion as in the permutation %vector.
However, the number of entries is not required to be equal to the set size of projectes indices.
Therefore, the projected %matrix/%vector may have less rows or columns:

\include reorder.cpp

Indices may appear repeatedly in the reorder %vector implying that the respective rows/columns 
appear multiple times in the resulting %matrix/%vector:

\include reorder2.cpp
 
Reordering matrices can also be used to compress matrices as in the following example:

\include reorder3.cpp

The multiplication from right allows for eliminating empty rows
and from left with the transposed for removing empty columns.
The transposed of the compression matrices enable the decompression to
yield the original matrices.
If memory is an issue, one can also keep the compression vectors and the size of the original %matrix and
create the compression %matrix on the fly.

\code
    dense2D<double>  C1(trans(mat::reorder(non_zero_rows, 4)) * B3),
                     C2(C1 * mat::reorder(non_zero_columns, 3));
\endcode


For the definition of the row compression %matrix we needed the explicit specification of the number of columns
because the reorder %matrix has by default the maximal entry plus one as column number
(i.e. the minimum that is necessary).
The number of columns of any reorder %matrix -- not only compression -- must be equal the number of rows
of the original %matrix when multiplied from left and equal the original number of columns when multiplied
from right as transposed.
This is implicitly given when the last row or column is part of the resulting %matrix.
If you are not sure about this fact or the compression %vector is calculated specify the reorder %matrix' columnn number explicitly.

\section Indirection

Matrix indirection, implemented in mat::indirect, is a view on an existing %matrix  restricted to certain indices.
It uses the type iset to define index sets.
The following program illustrates the usage:

\includelineno matrix_indirect.cpp

An \ref iset can be initialized with push_back() or simply assigned with a comma-separated list (line 13).
 (And yes, the comma operator is overloaded).
When isets are passed as indices to a %matrix, an object of type mat::indirect is created (line 16).
For the moment, \ref iset cannot be mixed with other types as index (e.g. to get a sub-vector within a matrix):
\code
   A[rows][1]; // Error !!!
\endcode
When the sub-matrix is accessed multiple times, it should be stored into an object as in in line 18.

Objects of type mat::indirect can be used in operations and this is tested to some extend.
In the future, %matrix indirections from dense matrices (in general, all matrices modifiable without inserter)
can be modified.


\section Comparison

For small sub-matrices, %matrix indirection is always faster than reordering because the latter involves
one or two matrix products.
For large permuted or reordered matrices, the multiplication(s) can be amortized by the  faster access to the elements later.

//-----------------------------------------------------------


/*! \page banded_matrices Banded Matrix View, Upper and Lower Triangular Views

For any %matrix A the upper and the strict upper triangular part can be accessed with the function 
upper and strict_upper:

\include upper.cpp

The functions return views on the arguments. The resulting view can be used in expressions but
this is not recommended in high-performance applications because the lower triangle is still 
traversed while returning zero values.
For the future it is planned to implement traversal of such views more efficiently.

Likewise lower and strict lower triangle matrices are yielded:

\include lower.cpp

In case of sparse matrices the assignment of a lower triangle %matrix leads to an efficient representation
because the entries in the upper part are not explicitly stored as zeros but omitted entirely.

The most general form of views in this section is returned by the function bands
(in fact the others are implemented by it).
It returns bands in terms of half-open intervals of diagonals.
For instance, the two off-diagonal right from the main diagonal are computed by bands(A, 1, 3):

\include bands.cpp

A tri-diagonal %matrix is returned for the band interval [-1, 2) as in the example above.
For performance reasons it is advisable to store the tri-diagonal %matrix in a compressed
format instead of using it directly.

The application of rank-one and rank-two updates are
illustrated in the following (hopefully self-explanatory)
program:

\include rank_two_update.cpp

The output of the %matrix is formatted for better readability.
The functions also work for sparse matrices although we
cannot recommend this for the sake of efficiency.

In the future, updates will be also expressible with operators.
For instance, rank_one_update(A, v, w) can be written as
A+= conj(v) * trans(w) if v and w are column vectors (if w
is a row %vector the transposition can-and must-be removed).
Thus, the orientation is relevant in operator notation
where the functions rank_one_update and rank_two_update
ignore the orientation.

For setting up tests quickly, we implemented some convenience functions that initialize matrices:

\include matrix_functions.cpp

Hessian matrices are scaled by a factor, i.e. \ref mat::hessian_setup (A, alpha) is:
\f[ A= [a_{ij}] = [\alpha * (i + j)] \f]
The funciton is intended for dense matrices.
It works on sparse matrices but it is very expensive for large matrices.

The Laplacian setup \ref mat::laplacian (A, m, n) 
initializes a matrices with the same values as a finite difference method 
for a Laplace (Poisson) equation on an \f$m\times n\f$ grid.
The matrix size is changed to \f$(m\cdot n)\times (m\cdot n)\f$.
After the setup the diagonal is 4 and four off-diagonals are mostly set to -1, i.e. a simple
five-point-stencil. 
It is intended for sparse matrices but also works on dense ones.

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page eigenvalues_intro Eigenvalues and SVD

\section Eigenvalues

\subsection eigenvalue_symm Symmetric Real Matrices

For the calculation of eigenvalues, we provide the following functions in MTL4. The default usage is:
\code
  eig= eigenvalue_symmetric(A);
\endcode
with %matrix A and %dense_vector eig of suitable size.
The default argument invokes a QR-algorithm with implicit symmetric QR-steps (Wilkinson-Shifts).
If the macro  MTL_SYMMETRIC_EIGENVALUE_WITH_QR is defined (or the according compile flag is set), 
this calls only the standard QR-Algorithm, which exchanges Q and R  num_rows(A) times.

You can also directly use the QR-Algorithm with
\code
  eig= qr_algo(A, n);
\endcode
This changes Q and R only n times if you know how many changes of Q and R you will need.

In the same way, you can directly call the QR-Algorithm with implicit symmetric Wilkinson shifts by
\code
  eig= qr_sym_imp(A);
\endcode

At the moment, our functions to calculate the eigenvalues ââonly work on dense matrices, because we need 
the matrix in Hessenberg form for the QR-Algorithm, and this is stored as a dense matrix.

For example:
\include eigenvalue_symmetric_example.cpp

\subsection eigenvalue_nonsymm Non-symmetric Real Matrices

Likewise, the eigenvalues of non-symmetric matrices can be computed with the mat::eigenvalue_solver:

\include eigenvalue_example.cpp

The algorithm uses single shifts when the matrix is symmetric where possible;
whenever the intermediate matrix requires, the algorithm switches to double shifts and
back when possible.
Disclaimer: if eigenvalues are too close, the algorithm might fail (not converge).

It is based on the QR-Given's rotation.
The latter can also be used stand-alone:
\include qr_givens_example.cpp

Whereas mat::qr_algo bases on Householder transformation and is more appropriate for 
more less dense matrices,
mat::qr_givens is more suitable for triangular matrices.

\section Singular Value Decomposition

A singular value decomposition of an \f$ m\times n \f$ real or complex matrix M is a factorization of the form
\f[ M=U \Sigma V^{*} \f]
with
- U:  real or complex unitary \f$ m \times m \f$ matrix
- \f$  \Sigma \f$: \f$ m\times n \f$ rectangular diagonal matrix with nonnegative real numbers on the diagonal
- \f$  V^{*} \f$:  (the conjugate transpose of V) is a \f$ n\times n \f$  real or complex unitary matrix
The diagonal entries \f$ \Sigma_{i,i} \f$ of \f$ \Sigma \f$ are known as the singular values of M.

For the calculation of the SVD we have a Matlab-like call
\code
  boost::tie(S, V, D)= svd(A, 1.e-10);
\endcode
or 
\code
  boost::tie(S, V, D)= svd(A);
\endcode
The second argument is optional and defines the missmatch of upper R (A= Q*R).
At the moment all four matrices have the same type. If A is a dense2D-matrix, then also U, 
\f$ \Sigma \f$ and V are returned as dense2D matrix.
Furthermore, this function works only for real matrices because
all known algorithms rely on complete order (e.g. x < 0).

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page cppeleven_intro Overview of C++11 Extensions

\section cppeleven_portability Portability 

New features of C++11 are introduced conditionally in a way such that compilers without support for 
the new features and those with partial support can still be used.
For that purpose, cmake checks for each single new feature whether it is suffiently supported by the
current compiler to use that feature for the MTL4 implementations.
In this case, applications using the CMake module MTLConfig (like the MTL4 tests)
 are compiled with an according macro.
For instance, when static assertions are available the programs are compiled with the flag
<tt>-DMTL_WITH_STATICASSERT</tt> (resp. <tt>/D</tt> on Windows).

At some point in the future, when pre-C++11 compilers are considered historic we will drop this
feature checking.
However, at this time we will certainly need to check C++14 and C++17 features.

We recommend using the MTLConfig module for detecting available features -- not only in the MTL4 test but also in applications.
However, if you prefer setting the enabling macro explicitly here is the list of C++11-related macros:
- <tt>MTL_WITH_AUTO</tt>: automatic type deduction with <tt>auto</tt> (might be used for decltype as well in the future),
- <tt>MTL_WITH_DEFAULTIMPL</tt>: default and deleted implementation for potentially generated member functions,
- <tt>MTL_WITH_INITLIST</tt>: initializer lists,
- <tt>MTL_WITH_MOVE</tt>: move semantics including <tt>std::move</tt> and <tt>std::forward</tt>,
- <tt>MTL_WITH_RANGEDFOR</tt>: range-based <tt>for</tt>-loop,
- <tt>MTL_WITH_STATICASSERT</tt>: <tt>static_assert</tt>,
- <tt>MTL_WITH_TEMPLATE_ALIAS</tt>: template aliases and non-template type definitions with <tt>using</tt>,
- <tt>MTL_WITH_VARIADIC_TEMPLATE</tt>: variadic templates.



\section cppeleven_move Move Semantics

%Matrix and vector types are now equipped with move constructors and move assignments.
For instance, consider the following example:

\include move_example.cpp

The function make_identity returns a matrix.
As this matrix is a temporary it can be moved instead of being copied.

\remark The historic move emulation (that did more harm than good)
 will be removed in the near future because it is superseded by the
language feature.

\section cppeleven_assert Static Assert

Compile-time assertions are now provided an error message.
In order to provide backward compatibility, we do not use static_assert directly but
by means of the new macro MTL_STATIC_ASSERT. 
(We know macros are ugly but there is no alternative here.)
The following example illustrates how you could use this macro:

\include static_assert_example.cpp

Here, we test whether our argument type is a dense matrix.
Otherwise, we emit a user-defined error message (not a particular polite one).
Assuming that static_assert is supported.
Without that feature, the macro falls back to BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT, i.e. the
error message is ignored but the test is still performed during compilation.
If backward compatibility is not an issue for you, it is certainly better
using static_assert directly.

Of course, all static assertions within MTL4 are replaced and will now print a more meaningful message.

\section cppeleven_initlist Initializer Lists

Initializer lists are supported in both constructors and assignments of matrices and vectors.
Their use should be self-explanatory:

\include init_list_example.cpp

Matrices are initialized with nested lists. 
MTL4 checks that all internal lists have the same size.

When an initializer list is assigned to a non-empty matrix or vector, the dimension must fit.

The advantages over the already available element-wise assignment with the overloaded comma operator
are:
- It can be used in constructors not only in assignments.
- Therefor, constant objects can be initialized.
- For matrices the dimensions are checked, not only the total number of elements.
- It can be used directly in function calls.
.

\section cppeleven_for Range-based For Loop

A cute new feature in C++11 is the range-based for loop.
It will shorten the notation for iterations in MTL4.
To start with, we slightly extended the interface of \ref irange.
It can now be used to implement a loop over integers with a compact notation:

\include ranged_for_example.cpp

The full expressiveness of the new loop notation is unleashed in the matrix traversal,
see \ref cppeleven_traversal.

\section cppeleven_other Other Features

We refrained from using features like "auto" and "decltype" in existing code (and use it only rarely in new code).
Although the sources would gain clarity, the impact on the user would be counter-productive:
the library would not provide more usability but older compilers would not be supported
any longer.
That does not mean that you should avoid these features. 
If you do not care about old compilers please feel free using all new C++11 features.
They should not conflict with the MTL4 implementation (otherwise let us know).

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page trisolve_intro Triangular Solvers


Linear systems A * x == b are easy to solve if A is an upper/lower triangular matrix.
We provide a generic function to perform this operation:
\code
  x= upper_trisolve(A, b);
\endcode
The %matrix A must be triangular %matrix otherwise the function can throw an exception.
(For dense matrices the lower part is currently ignored but this might change in the future.)
If A has a unit diagonal, the diagonal entries can be omitted if the system is solved by:
\code
  x= unit_upper_trisolve(A, b);
\endcode
The implicit diagonal decreases the stress on the memory bandwidth and avoids expensive divisions.

On matrices with non-unit diagonals, the divisions can be circumvented by inverting the diagonal
once with invert_diagonal(A) and then using:
\code
  x= inverse_upper_trisolve(A, b);
\endcode
Especially if A is used as preconditioner of an iterative method, the substitution of divisions by 
multiplications can lead to a significant speed-up.

Likewise, the functions for lower triangular matrices are defined:
\code
  x= lower_trisolve(A, b);
  x= unit_lower_trisolve(A, b);
  x= inverse_lower_trisolve(A, b);
\endcode

\section trisolve_noncopy Non-copying Triangular Solvers

To avoid the time spent on copying the resulting one can pass the target vector
as third argument to the functions:
\code
  lower_trisolve(A, b, x);
  unit_lower_trisolve(A, b, x);
  inverse_lower_trisolve(A, b, x);
\endcode
Likewise with upper triangular matrices.

\section trisolve_object Triangular Solver Objects [advanced]

If the same %matrix is used in multiple triangular solutions, e.g. in preconditioners,
 it can be beneficial to create a solver object -- more precisely to keep the solver
object that is created anyway.
The solver classes mat::detail::lower_trisolve_t and mat::detail::upper_trisolve_t
have  three template arguments:
- %Matrix: The type of the matrix;
- DiaTag: A tag type how the diagonal of the matrix is stored;
- CompactStorage: A Boolean whether the matrix is compactly stored.
.
The tag for the storage of the diagonal must be one of the following three types:
- tag::regular_diagonal: the diagonal is stored in the canonical manner as it is supposed in lower_trisolve;
- tag::inverse_diagonal: the diagonal is inverted and the solver multiplies by its values instead of dividing;
- tag::unit_diagonal: the diagonal is assumed to contain 1 entries (or the according identity element of the multiplication)
.
Compact storage as declared in the third argument means that the matrix only contains entries that
are needed in the solver.
In case of a lower triangular solver the upper triangle is not stored in the matrix (accordingly for
upper).
For unit_diagonal solvers, there must be no entries on the diagonal. 
%Matrix types that do not allow omitting the according entries -- like mat::dense2D -- cannot be
used with compact storage.
Without compact storage all matrix types are allowed and arbitrary entries can be present in the
matrix; however, a small overhead for searching the relevant entries is the price.

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page krylov_intro Introduction Krylov-Subspace Methods

The natural notation in MTL4 allows you to write Krylov-Subspace methods in the same way as in the mathematical
literature.
For instance, consider the conjugate gradient method as it is realized in the ITL version that is in the process of revision:

\include cg.hpp 

For the sake of performance, we specialized the CG method for the case that no preconditioner is used respectively
the identity preconditioner is applied.

In this implementation, we also merge operations whenever possible to achieve better locality and less cache hits.
The merging is entirely generic in the sense that the notation can be used with arbitrary operations on arbitrary
types.
Operations on types that are not mergeable are evaluated sequentially.

The usage of expression templates, several specializations and the merging allows for performing more than 20 iterations
per second 
 with one million unknowns and a Laplacian five-point-stencil as matrix (explicitly stored) 
on a commodity PC.

/*! \page using_solvers Using Predefined Linear Solvers

The following program illustrates how to solve a linear system:

\include ilu_0_bicgstab.cpp

Currently the folling solvers (in alphabetical order) are available:
- Bi-Conjugate Gradient: itl::bicg(A, x, b, L, iter); 
- Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized: itl::bicgstab(A, x, b, L, iter);
- Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized(2): itl::bicgstab_2(A, x, b, L, iter); 
- Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized(ell): itl::bicgstab_ell(A, x, b, L, R, iter, ell); 
- Conjugate Gradient: itl::cg(A, x, b, L, iter); 
- Conjugate Gradient Squared: itl::cgs(A, x, b, L, iter); 
- Generalized Minimal Residual method (without restart): itl::gmres_full(A, x, b, L, R, iter); 
- Generalized Minimal Residual method with restart: itl::gmres(A, x, b, L, R, iter, restart); 
- Induced Dimension Reduction on s dimensions (IDR(s)): itl::idr_s(A, x, b, L, R, iter, s); 
- Quasi-minimal residual: itl::qmr(A, x, b, L, R, iter); and
- Transposed-free Quasi-minimal residual: itl::tfqmr(A, x, b, L, R, iter).
.
All Krylov sub-space methods solve the linear system Ax = b as in the example above.
A left preconditioner  L is used in all methods and some methods also 
incorporate a right preconditioner  R.
The iteration object controls the termination of the iteration, see below.
Some algorithms take an additional argument (ell, kmax_in, restart, s) specifying the dimension of the 
%vector space regarding to which new search directions are orthogonalized.
The difference between gmres and gmres_full is that continues until one criterion in iter holds.
gmres_full computes at most kmax_in iterations (or size(x) depending on what is smaller) 
regardless on whether the termination criterion is reached or not.
Needless to say that gmres is implemented by means of gmres_full.

As preconditioners we provide at the moment:
- Identity: that is no preconditioning: itl::pc::identity<Matrix, Value>;
- Diagonal inversion: the inverse of diagonal is stored and used in element-wise multiplication: itl::pc::diagonal<Matrix, Value>;
- ILU(0): Incomplete LU factorization without fill-in: itl::pc::ilu_0<Matrix, Value>;
- ILUT: Incomplete LU factorization with threshold (still under development): itl::pc::ilut<Matrix, Value>; 
- IC(0): Incomplete Cholesky factorization without fill-in: itl::pc::ic_0<Matrix, Value>; and
- IMF(s): Incomplete Multifrontal LU Decomposition with s levels of fill-in: itl::pc::imf_preconditioner<Value>
.
The first template argument is the type of the considered matrix and the second one the value_type of
preconditioner's internal data, see \ref tuning_value_type. 
Except for the last preconditioner, this only requires the value type of element matrices and not the entire assembled matrix.
More details are available at \ref imf_preconditioner.

The iteration object can be chosen between:
- Basic iteration does not generate output: basic_iteration(r0, m, r, a= 0);
- Cyclic iteration prints residual information every  c iteration: cyclic_iteration(r0, m, r, a= 0, c= 100, out= std::cout); and
- Noisy iteration prints residual in each iteration: noisy_iteration(r0, m, r, a= 0, out= std::cout).
.
Mandatory arguments for the iteration objects' constructors are the initial residuum  r0 (which is of course  b if one starts
with  x = 0), the maximal number of iteration and the relative error reduction (more precisely residuum reduction).
Optionally, the absolute residuum  a (fourth argument) can be given as termination criterion.
Thus the iterative methods are terminated when either:
- The maximum number of iterations is reached (failure);
- The relative residuum reduction was achieved; or
- The absolute residuum is below  a if specified.
.
In the cyclic iteration, the user can specify after how many iterations the residual informations are printed,
default is 100. 
For cyclic and noisy iterations, one can declare on which ostream the information is printed.
This enables printing it into log files or for parallel computing printing only on one processor.
By default the output is printed into std::out.

General assumptions on solver iterations:
- 0th iteration is the starting residue.
- Once the input value (x) is changed you have made at least one iteration.
- Fractions of iterations that change x (and r) are counted as whole iterations.

/*! \page imf_preconditioner Using the IMF-Preconditioner
 
The following program illustrates how to use the IMF preconditioner to solve a linear system: 

\include imf_example.cpp

The use of the IMF preconditioner differs slightly from the other preconditioners. 
For the use of the IMF preconditioner, element matrices are needed which typically occur at a FEM discretization.
The IMF preconditioner works on these small element matrices, 
whose assembly results in the system matrix which is not explicitly used by the IMF preconditioner.

Once you have created the element structure, it is simplest approach to store the elements in a file and leave
it to preconditioner setup to deduce the neighborhood.
The more efficient approach is building the element structure matrix from the  element topology (which should 
be known in the simulation already).
However, this requires an interface to the software that generates the elements.

The before-mentioned file should provide the following structure, e.g. in square3.mtx:
\code
36
1.1111111e1
0 1 7 8 
1.0 2.0 2.0 1.0
4.0 4.0 2.0 1.0
1.0 2.0 4.0 1.0
1.0 2.0 3.0 1.0

1 2 8 9 
1.0 2.0 2.0 1.0
4.0 6.0 2.0 1.0
3.0 6.0 2.0 1.0
1.0 2.0 2.0 1.0
\endcode
 The first line contains the number of elements in the mesh: the 36 elements originate from a 
regular 6 by 6 mesh.
The second line can contain the condition number of the system.
It can be used to investigate the numerical properties of IMF.
If the condition number is omitted or incorrect, the preconditioner still works correctly.
In the next line, the vertex indices of the first element: 0, 1, 7, 8 are given.
In our case, we have 4 indices so that a 4 by 4 matrix follows.
Element matrices are separated by blank lines.

With this information, you can create the IMF preconditioner.

To solve a linear system with this preconditioner, you have two options. 
You can assemble from the small element matrices a large sparse matrix (like matrix B in our example)
and apply the solver routines on it.
Alternatively, you can use directly the element structure (named A in our example) to solve the system. 

Using the element structure directly in matrix vector products and similar operations has a trade-off:
- It provides higher floating point performance since dense matrices are used;
- It requires more floating point operations due to redundant storage and potentially explicitly stored zeros; and
- Usually less explicitly stored indices (unless the vertices in the elements are very redundant).
.
In our experiments, the performance of operations with element structures was higher than with assembled matrices,
but this depends on the matrix at hand.

/*! \page iteration Iteration


Iterative traversal of collections is implemented in MTL4 in two ways:
- By iterators and
- By cursors and property maps
.
The latter is more general and allows especially for sparse structures 
a cleaner abstraction.
Initially MTL4 was implemented entirely with this paradigm but it
has shown that algorithms running exclusively on dense structures
are easier to implement in terms of iterators.

All cursors and iterators are handled by:
- The function begin();
- The function end(); and
- The class range_generator.


They are all templated by a tag that determines the form of traversal.
The following tags are currently available for cursors:
- tag::all: iterate over all elements of a collection (or sub-collection);
- tag::nz: iterate over all non-zero elements;
- tag::row: iterate over all rows;
- tag::col: iterate over all columns;
- tag::major: iterate over the major dimension (according to orientation, rows for row-major, ...);
- tag::minor: iterate over the minor dimension (according to orientation, columns for row-major, ...).
.
For iterators:
- tag::iter::all: iterate over all elements of a collection (or sub-collection);
- tag::iter::nz: iterate over all non-zero elements.
.
And finally for constant iterators:
- tag::const_iter::all: iterate over all elements of a collection (or sub-collection);
- tag::const_iter::nz: iterate over all non-zero elements.
.

Let's consider cursors in more detail.


\section cursor Cursors 

The approach was proposed by David Abrahams in order to separate the
form of traversal from the manner of access.
A cursor is a tool that can be used to visit different objects of a collection.
In an array it can be compared with a position rather than a pointer
because it is not %fixed how one accesses the values.
The traversal is essential the same as with iterators, e.g.:
\code
    for (Cursor cursor(begin(x)), cend(end(x)); cursor != cend; ++cursor)
       do_something(cursor);
\endcode
We will come back to the type Cursor later (please be patient).

In order to have more flexibility we templatized the begin and end functions:
\code
    for (Cursor cursor(begin<tag::all>(x)), cend(end<tag::all>(x)); cursor != cend; ++cursor)
       do_something(cursor);
\endcode
This cursor for instance goes over all elements of a %matrix or %vector, including
structural zeros.

\section nested_cursor Nested Cursors 

Several cursors can be used to create other cursors.
This is necessary to traverse multi-dimensional collections like matrices.
In most cases you will use nested cursors via the tags tag::row and tag::col.
The returned cursor can be a certain collection (e.g. a %vector)
or just a place-holder that only contains some index and reference
to a collection but cannot be used directly in operations.
If the type and orientation permits, one can access the elements with
tag::all or tag::nz, e.g.:
\code
    for (Cursor cursor(begin<tag::row>(x)), cend(end<tag::row>(x)); cursor != cend; ++cursor)
       for (ICursor icursor(begin<tag::nz>(cursor)), icend(end<tag::nz>(cursor)); icursor != icend; ++icursor)
           do_something(icursor);
\endcode
Often it is more efficient to adapt an algorithm to the orientation of a %matrix.
Then it is convenient to use tag::major instead of dispatching for row-major and column major matrices:
\code
    for (Cursor cursor(begin<tag::major>(x)), cend(end<tag::major>(x)); cursor != cend; ++cursor)
       for (ICursor icursor(begin<tag::nz>(cursor)), icend(end<tag::nz>(cursor)); icursor != icend; ++icursor)
           do_something(icursor);
\endcode


\section property_maps Property Maps

The concept of property maps has not only the advantage to allow for different
forms of accessibility of values but also to provide different views or details
of this value.
Matrices have four property maps:
- row;
- col; 
- value; and
- const_value.
.
They are all accessed by dereferenced cursors, e.g.
\code
    for (Cursor cursor(begin<tag::nz>(x)), cend(end<tag::nz>(x)); cursor != cend; ++cursor)
	cout << "matrix[" << row(*cursor) << ", " << col(*cursor) << "] = " 
	     << const_value(*cursor) << '\n';
\endcode
Three of the property maps are constant (guess which).
Obviously only value can be changed. The syntax is the following:
\code
    value(*cursor, 7);
\endcode

\section range_generator Range Generator

The type %traits traits::range_generator<Tag, Collection>
is used to determine the type of cursor:
\code
    typedef typename traits::range_generator<tag::row, Matrix>::type c_type;
    typedef typename traits::range_generator<tag::nz, c_type>::type  ic_type;

    for (c_type cursor(begin<tag::row>(x)), cend(end<tag::row>(x)); cursor != cend; ++cursor)
       for (ic_type icursor(begin<tag::nz>(cursor)), icend(end<tag::nz>(cursor)); icursor != icend; ++icursor)
           do_something(icursor);
\endcode
As can be seen in the examples, cursors that represents sub-collections (e.g. rows) can
be used as collection type.

\section iterators Iterators

In some contexts, especially with dense data only,
iterators are simpler to use.
With the property map syntax, one cannot apply operators like +=
or a modifying function.
Therefore we provide iterators for dense matrices and vectors.
For sparse matrices there was no use case so far because iterators
do not reveal which %matrix element they are pointing at.

The usage of iterators is very similar to those of cursors:
\code
    for (Iter iter(begin<tag::const_iter::nz>(x)), iend(end<tag::const_iter::nz>(x)); 
         iter != iend; ++iter)
	cout << "matrix value = " << *iter << '\n';
\endcode
In contrast to the previous examples we can only output the value without the indices.
The type of Iter can be determined with range_generator in the same way.

\section nested_iterators Nested Iterators 

Nesting of iterators is also analog to cursors.
However, iterators only exist to access elements not sub-collections.
The nesting is therefore realized by mixing cursors and iterators.
\code
    for (Cursor cursor(begin<tag::major>(x)), cend(end<tag::major>(x)); cursor != cend; ++cursor)
        for (Iter iter(begin<tag::const_iter::nz>(cursor)), iend(end<tag::const_iter::nz>(cursor)); 
             iter != iend; ++iter)
	    cout << "matrix value = " << *iter << '\n';
\endcode
In the example we iterate over the rows by a cursor and then iterate over the elements with
an iterator.

\section range_complete Complete Example 

The following program shows an entire program for iterating over all non-zero
elements with cursors and property maps:

\include complete_iteration.cpp

The outer loop iterates over the major dimension, i.e. over the rows of A (that in main) and the
columns of B.
The inner loop iterates over the structural non-zeros (i.e. wherever a value is physically stored
in memory) of that rows or columns.
From each of these entries, the row and column index as well as their value is printed.

\section cppeleven_traversal Traversal in C++11

The principle remains the same but with the range-based for loop and automatic type detection,
the traversal can be written much more compactly:

\include ranged_for_iteration.cpp

This program does exactly the same as the previous one.
The ifdefs are only needed because we test-compile the examples on different compilers including some without
C++11 support.

To enable this compact notation, we introduced new generator functions: mat::row_map, mat::col_map, 
mat::offset_map,
mat::value_map, and mat::const_value_map for the property maps.
Likewise, their are new functions that return cursor ranges, e.g. begin<tag::row>(A) and end<tag::row>(A)
corresponds to rows_of(A).
The new functions are:
- \ref rows_of for traversing the rows, corresponds to \ref tag::row;
- \ref cols_of for traversing the columns, corresponds to tag::col;
- \ref major_of for traversing the major dimension, corresponds to tag::major;
- \ref minor_of for traversing the major dimension, corresponds to tag::minor;
- \ref nz_of for traversing the non-zeros of a row/column or entire container, corresponds to tag::nz;
- \ref all_of for traversing all entries of a row/column or entire container, corresponds to tag::all;
- \ref range_of: parametrized traversal whatever tag is given as template argument.

This functions are defined in the mtl namespace and imported in mtl::matrix to be caught by ADL.
Likewise, they will be imported in namespace mtl::vector for vector traversal (not implemented yet).
More discussion on C++11 features and backward compatibility is found on page \ref cppeleven_intro.

\section range_complexity Advanced topic: Choosing traversal by complexity

Range generators in MTL4 have a notion of complexity.
That is for a given collection and a given form of traversal it can
be said at compile time which complexity this traversal has.

Dense matrices are traversed with linear or cached_linear complexity.
The latter is used for contiguous memory access over strided ones,
which is also linear but considerably slower.
This distinction is mathematically questionable but useful
in practical contexts.

Sparse matrices have linear complexity when traversed along the orientation.
Traversing compressed matrices perpendicular to the orientation 
(e.g. a CRS %matrix column-wise)
has infinite complexity because it is not implemented.
Moreover, the default (non-spezialized) range_generator has infinite
complexity so that it is per se defined for arbitrary collections and tags.
Whether the range generator is actually really implemented can be tested
by comparing the complexity with infinite (by using MPL functions).

The following example shows a simpler way to find out the best traversal:
\include minimize_complexity.cpp

Please not that the example uses compressed sparse matrices and not all
forms of traversion are supported.
Obviously a linear complexity is lower than an infinite and the 
range generator without implementation is never used.
As the free functions begin() and end() are internally always implemented
by member functions of range_generator (free template functions cannot be 
spezialized partially) we used directly the member functions in the example.


The range generator can also be minimized recursively between three and
more alternatives:
\code
    typedef typename min<range_generator<tag::row, Matrix>, 
	                 typename min<range_generator<tag::col, Matrix>,
	                              range_generator<tag::major, Matrix> >::type 
                        >::type range_type;
\endcode

In many cases there is no need for explicitly minimizing the complexity because
tag::major usually will yield the same results (but this is not so cool).

/*! \page rec_intro Recursion


Recursion is an important theme in MTL4.
Besides matrices with recursive recursive memory layout -- cf. \ref matrix_types and \ref mat::morton_dense --
%recursion with regard to algorithms plays a decisive role.

To support the implementation of recursive algorithms we introduced -- in collaboration with David S. Wise --
the concept to Recursator, an analogon of <a href=" http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Iterators.html">Iterator</a>.
The class mat::recursator enables recursive subdivision of all matrices with a sub_matrix function
(e.g., dense2D and morton_dense).
We refrained from providing the sub_matrix functionality to compressed2D; this would possible but very inefficient
and therefor not particularly useful.
Thus mat::recursator of mat::compressed2D cannot be declared.
A recursator for vectors is planned for the future.

Generally spoken, the mat::recursator 
consistently divides a %matrix into four quadrants 
- north_west;
- north_east;
- south_west; and
- south_east;
.
with the self-evident cartographic meaning (from here on we abreviate %matrix recursator to recursator).
The quadrants itself can be sub-divided again providing the recursive sub-division of matrices
into scalars (or blocks with user-defined maximal size).

The following program illustrates how to divide matrices via recursator:

\include recursator.cpp

The functions north_west(), north_east(), south_west(), and south_east()  return recursators
that refer to sub-matrices.
The sub-matrices can be accessed by dereferring the recursator, i.e. *rec.
Only then a sub-matrix is created. 

As the example shows, the quadrant (represented by a recursator) can be sub-divided
further (returning another recursator).
Block-recursive algorithms can be implemented efficiently by sub-dividing large matrices
recursively into blocks of decreasing size until a block size is reached that allows efficient
iterative treatment.
Sub-matrices are only created at the base case and not during the recursive descent
because the creation of sub-matrix might be a relatively expensive %operation (e.g., with morton_dense) 
while the creation of a new recursator requires only a few integer %operations.

The recursator uses internally a virtual bound that is a power of 2 and at least as large as
the number of rows and columns.
In the example, the bound is 16 (as shown by the member function bound).
When computing a quadrant the bound is halved and the starting row and column are potentially increased.
For instance, the north_east quadrant is a virtual 8 by 8 %matrix starting at row 0 and column 8.
The sub-matrix referred by the north_east recursator is the intersection of this virtual quadrant with
the original %matrix A, i.e. an 8 by 2 %matrix starting in row 0 and column 8.

More functionality of recursators is shown in the following example:

\include recursator2.cpp

The function is_empty applied on a recursator computes whether the referred sub-matrix is empty,
i.e. the intersection of the virtual quadrant and the original %matrix A is empty.
The sub-matrix itself is not generated since this test can be performed from size and index information.
In the same way, number of rows and columns of the referred sub-matrix can be computed without its creation.

The function is_full() comes in handy in block-recursive algorithms.
Assume we have a base case of 64 by 64, i.e. matrices with at most 64 rows and columns are treated iteratively.
Then it is worthwile to write a blazingly fast iterative implementation  for 64 by 64 matrices,
in other words when the sub-matrix fills the entire virtual quadrant (when bound is 64).
Thus, the function is_full() can be used to dispatch between this optimized code and the (hopefully not
much slower) code for smaller matrices.

/*! \page umfpack_intro Umfpack Interface

The interface to Umfpack allows you to use a direct solver rather conveniently.

\section umfpack_compiling Compiling and Linking with the Umfpack

The bad news is that cmake has no module for finding Umfpack (and we haven't written
it either).
Thus, applications using the umfpack interface need additional compiler and linker flags, e.g.:
- Compiler flags: <tt>-DMTL_HAS_UMFPACK -I/home/pgottsch/Software/UMFPACK-5.3.0/Include -I/home/pgottsch/Software/AMD/Include -I/home/pgottsch/Software/UFconfig</tt>
- Linker flags: <tt>-L/home/pgottsch/Software/UMFPACK-5.3.0/Lib -lumfpack -L/home/pgottsch/Software/AMD/Lib -lamd -lblas</tt>

To enable the interface at all "MTL_HAS_UMFPACK" must be defined.
Then one needs to include the directory of Umfpack's headers and that of libraries used by it: AMD (that has nothing to do with the company) and
UFconfig.
These flags can of course be omitted for those headers in default include directories.

The linker flags above add Umfpack, AMD and BLAS.
The directories of course only needed when they are searched by default as in our case.
The BLAS library can be omitted as well if Umfpack is configured without BLAS (what nobody does).
Make sure that your object file comes before these library flags.

The interface is not tested on Visual Studion but the flags should be similar
in case you spent the time compiling these packages on Windows.

\section umfpack_simple Simple Solution

If you a %matrix A and a %vector b for which you want to solve "A * x == b" you can just write:
\code
    umfpack_solve(A, x, b);
\endcode
In this case, the matrix is factorized and directly applied on the vector \p b.



\section umfpack_multi Multiple and Customized Solution

If you want to reuse the matrix factorization from Umfpack you must define
an object of type \ref mat::umfpack::solver.
The matrix is constantly referred in the solver's constructor.
Additional arguments can be given, see  \ref mat::umfpack::solver and the 
<a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack">Umfpack documentation</a>.

\includelineno umfpack_solve_example.cpp

The solver is created in line 31.
The constructor calls according to its type the functions umfpack_xy_symbolic and umfpack_xy_numeric
which compute a matrix factorization.
These data is keept in the solver object and can be reused for multiple linear systems with
the same matrix.

In line 34 the solver is applied on \p b and on \p b2 (line 35).
Note that calling umfpack_solve twice would be significantly more work.

\subsection umfpack_changevalue Changing a Matrix Value

In line 38 we modified an existing entry of A.
(The function lvalue is not portable and a bit dangerous. If the referred entry does not exists it throws an exception.)
The sparsity structure is not changed.
This allows us to update only the numeric part in Umfpack while the symbolic part is unchanged.

\subsection umfpack_changestructure Changing the Matrix Structure

Adding new entries into the matrix (line 51) requires a complete update, 
i.e. a complete new factorization (line 56).
From the performance prospective, we could as well create a new solver -- this would be the same work.
However, for software engineering there can be situations where changing an existing solver
results in cleaner sources.

If we had updated the solver with update_numeric() only the internal Umfpack state is broken.
This will probably cause the next solver call to fail (we are not sure if sometimes goes through
with wrong results).

\section umfpack_status Return Status

The solver class checks after each Umfpack call whether status "Ok" is returned 
and throws an exception otherwise.
In release mode (when NDEBUG) is defined, no exceptions are thrown.
The status is also returned to the user (see line 59) -- as long as no exception is thrown beforehand.

//-----------------------------------------------------------


/*! \page vampir_trace_intro Vampir Trace

<a href="http://www.vampir.eu/">Vampir</a> is one of the leading event analyzer and visualization tools
for performance optimization.

There are several possibilities for automatic generation of event traces during the program execution
using automatic instrumentation.
Such automatic instrumentation is very convenient for applications with coarse grained functions. But:
- The heavy use of many small inline functions in MTL4 would extremely distort the run behavior
  when every function would be instrumented.
-  Furthermore, having the complete type information of each argument of a template's function instantiation
would impede concise displays.

For that reasons, we use manual instrumentation in MTL4.

\section vampir_compiling Compiling and Linking

First we assume that Vampir Trace (>= 7.0) is installed and the compiler "vtc++" is
in the path.

If your program is in the MTL directory run cmake with enabled Vampir Trace:\n\n
<tt>cmake -DENABLE_VAMPIR=True</tt>\n\n
Our module will search for vtc++ and use the options provided by the wrapper.
CMake also adds the macro "MTL_HAS_VAMPIR"

You also need to set the environment variable VT_GROUPS_SPEC to the vampir_group.dat file in the 
MTL root directory, for instance::\n\n
<tt>export VT_GROUPS_SPEC=/home/pgottsch/projects/mtl4/trunk/vampir_groups.dat</tt>\n\n
Vampir works without this file but with it, the operations are color-grouped regarding the
classification below.

\section vampir_instrumentation Instrumentation

In the following program we instrumented a toy example:

\includelineno vampir_example.cpp

Each function to be instrumented starts with the definition of a 
\ref vpt::vampir_trace object.
The class is imported into the \ref mtl namespace (thus visible in all nested namespaces).
The objects do not need to be removed 
when Vampir Trace support is disabled (the class then contains empty inline functions).

The class has an integer template argument which is uniquely associated with a (function) name.
The name is represented by a static member and set for each template specialization
of \ref vpt::vampir_trace as in line 15 of the example above.

<b>To not running into conflict with the MTL-internal instrumentation 
you should use numbers above 10,000.</b>

The name of vampir_trace<9999> is already defined as "main".

We furthermore added "my_add" in the file vampir_group.dat to get the appropriate coloring (as vector operation).

The result of the tracing is shown in the following picture:

\image html vampir_example_trace.png

The performance in this example is lousy because it was compiled with O0 and nothing
was inlined. True applications are of course much, much faster.


\section vampir_categories Categories

The operations are categorized into the following groups:

- 0. Utilities
- 1. Static-size operations
- 2. %Vector operations
- 3. %Matrix %vector & single matrix
- 4. %Matrix %matrix operations
- 5. Factorizations, preconditioners
- 6. Fused operations
- 7. Iterative solvers
- 9. Main function, test blocks and user applications

This categorization is more or less driven by complexity and level of abstraction.
Utilities are simple scalar function. Fused operations are when multiple vector or matrix
expressions are evaluated simultaneously.
The category of a function is defined by its number, e.g. vector operations have
numbers from 2000 to 2999.
These numbers are used in a script to generate the group file.

\section vampir_enable To Trace or Not To Trace

Events are only traced when MTL_HAS_VPT is defined: either by enabling Vampir in CMake or
by passing it as compile flag by hand or defining the macro in the program.
By default the first two categories are not traced because these functions are very short
and their instrumentation would distort the entire tracing.

There is another macro to control which function is traced: MTL_VPT_LEVEL.
By default it is set to 2. That means that functions of category 2 or higher are instrumented.
If one wants instrumenting static-size operations but no utilities one compiles
the application with the flag:\n\n
<tt>-DMTL_VPT_LEVEL=1</tt>\n\n
or sets the flag with ccmake.

\section vampir_rational Rational

We considered passing the function name as argument to the constructor instead
of identifying the function with an integer template argument.
However, this does not work due to the internal representation of strings in vampir trace.
Furthermore, the static strings have much less overhead.

If you add your self-instrumented functions to the vampir_group.dat file of MTL4 the
next update will override (with packages) it or create a conflict (with subversion).
If you add a new category at the end of the file, at least the subversions update should not
remove your personal modifications.

If you write for instance the following simple program:

    std::complex<double>  z(2.0, 3.0);
    std::cout << "2 * z = " << 2 * z << '\n';

Then the compiler would complain something like:

\verbatim

The reason is simply that the standard complex header contains for any complex<T> only operations with T or
complex<T>.
In the example, 2 is an int and z a complex<double>.

Of course, we can write
\code

and 
\code
    std::cout << "2 * z = " << 2.0f * z << '\n';
\endcode
if z is complex<float>.
But the topic becomes much more cumbersome within generic functions.

/*! \page function_nesting Why and How we use Functors

The standard user interface of MTL4 consists of functions and operators.
Internally these functions are often implemented by means of functors.
This has two reasons. The first reason is that functions cannot be partially specialized
(cf. <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2001/n1295.asc">Document 
number J16/01-0009 = WG21 N1295 from the C++ Standard Committee</a>)
and the second reason is that functors allow an arbitrary composition.
We illustrate in this section how function-like interfaces can be enriched by partial
specialization and composition.

Assume we want to write a templated multiplication function for matrices:

\include nesting/function.hpp

Dense %matrix multiplication is the first operation where all the techniques on
this page are applied.
Of course it is planned to extend other %operations in the same manner.



\section functor_sec1 Step 1: Transform a Function into a Functor

We replace this function by a class containing an application operator
with the same signature:

\include nesting/functor.hpp

An object of this class

\include nesting/functor_obj.hpp

can be called like a function. Admittedly, the definition of this functor does not look very elegant.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to provide composition and partial specialization whereby the impact for
the user can be minimized by the techniques described below.

Remark: the suffix "_ft" stands for fully templated, in contrast to functor classes where all or part of
the types are automatically instantiated, as shown in step x.


\section functor_sec2 Step 2: Template Specialization

After the functor is implemented with a default behavior, one can write specializations for a certain
type or like in our case a certain combination of types:

\include nesting/special_functor.hpp

Please note that specializations are not required to be written in the same file as the template function
(i.e. by the same author) but can be added in any file that is included in the compilation unit.

By the way, this explicit form of specialization is also supported for functions (but the following 
techniques are not).


\section functor_sec3 Step 3: Partial Specialization

Very often specializations are not only possible for one single type (or tuple of types) but for an entire
set of types.
If, for instance, a more efficient implementation of mult is available for arbitrary triplets of dense2D matrices
regardless their respective value types and parameters, the functor can be partially specialized:

\include nesting/partial_functor.hpp

Again, such specializations can be added later. 
This becomes very handy when users define their own (%matrix) types and 
can also provide specialized implementations for certain functions or operators
which are implemented in terms of functors.


\section functor_sec4 Step 4: Reuse of Functors 


Assume we want implement a functor that multiplies matrices using BLAS routines.
We know upfront that only a few type triplets are supported and all other %matrix types
need another implementation.
One solution to implement such a functor is to call by default an already implemented
function and specialize this functor for certain type typles:

\include nesting/blas_functor_ugly.hpp

This code works but we can write it more elegantly with public inheritence:

\include nesting/blas_functor.hpp

This program is not only shorter but can eventually reduce the compilation cost,
for details look in David Abraham's book for meta-function forwarding. 


\section functor_sec5 Step 5: Conditional Specialization


This is only a small change but it can make a conceivable difference.
BLAS routines impressingly fast but we do not want to require mandatorily BLAS to be installed.
Guarding the specializations with configuration-dependent macros allows us to provide
the BLAS functions only when they are available.

\include nesting/blas_functor_cond.hpp

In case BLAS is not installed in MTL4, the programs calling the BLAS functor 
still work (not necessarily as fast).

In fact if you call an MTL4 functor, you are guaranteed that the operation is 
correctly performed.
If a functor with an optimized implementation cannot handle a certain type tuple,
it calls another functor that can handle it (otherwise calls yet another functor in turn
that can perform the operation (otherwise ...)).




\section functor_sec6 Step 6: Functor Composition


Resuming the previous sections, we can define a default behavior and one or more
specialized behaviors for a template functor.
Now we like to costumize the default behavior of functors.

The only thing we need to do for it is to introduce a template parameter for
the default functionality:


\include nesting/blas_functor_comp.hpp

The parameter for the default functor can of course have a default value, as in the example.
The name "Backup" is understood that the functors implement a functionality for a certain
set of type tuples.
Type tuples that are not in this set are handled by the Backup functor.
Theoretically, such functors can be composed arbitrarily.
Since this is syntantically somewhat cumbersome we will give examples later.


\section functor_sec7 Step 7: Functors with Automatic Instantiation

The usage of functors had two purposes: the partial specialization and the composition.
The former requires all types to be template arguments while the composition
does not.
Therefore we introduce another category of functors where the function arguments 
are not template arguments.
These functors (more precisely their operators) call the fully templated functors
to not loose the capability of partial specialization:

\include nesting/blas_functor_auto.hpp

Before we finally come to some examples we want to introduce another template
parameter.
This leads us to the actual implementation of the functors, 
for instance the BLAS functor:

\include nesting/blas_functor_mtl.hpp

The parameter Assign allows the realization of C= A*B, C+= A*B, and C-= A*B with the
same implementation (an explanation will follow) by setting Assign respectively to
assign::assign_sum, assign::plus_sum, and assign::minus_sum.
At this point we focus on the composition.

The duality of fully and partially templated functors simplifies the syntax of composed
functors significantly.
Already the default type of the backup functor can benefit from the shorter syntax
as shown in the example above.


\section functor_avail Available Functors


MTL4 provides several functors for dense %matrix multiplication:
-# Canonical implementation with 3 nested loops and iterators;
-# A corresponding 3-loop implementation with cursors and property maps;
-# Tiled products for regular matrices using pointers with
   -# With tile size 2 by 2;
   -# With tile size 4 by 4; and 
   -# Costumizable tile size;
   .
-# Recursive %matrix product with costumizable base case (kernel);
-# Platform optimized implementation; and
   -# So far only one implementation from Michael Adams for Opteron
   .
-# BLAS functor calling the corresponding routines.

All these functors have a Backup parameter which is by default set to 
the canonical implementation with iterators.
The two canonical products support all combination of %matrix types
and their Backup parameter is only added to unify the interface.

\section functor_example Functor Composition Example

As an example, we want to define a functor that calls:
- BLAS if available, otherwise
- The platform-specific code if available, otherwise
- The 4 by 4 tiled product, otherwise
- The canonical implementation.

The Backup parameter needs only be set if another then the canonical implementation
is used.
If you use typedefs it is advisable to work from buttom up through the list:
The tiled 4 by 4 product has already the right defaults.
The platform-specific version needs a non-default backup parameter.
This requires also the definition of the Assign parameter because it is
positioned before.
We keep this combined functor type as a type definition and use
it finally in the BLAS functor.
Here we create directly an object of this type which can be later called like a function:

\include nesting/comp_example.hpp

Now we defined a functor that can handle arbitrary combinations of dense %matrix types.
We also specified our preferences how to compute this operation.
When the compiler instantiate our functor for a given type combination it takes
the first product implementation in our list that is admissible.

/*! \page direct_access Direct Access to Matrices' Internal Data

MTL4 is primarily aiming to provide an interface that allows users to implement their
algorithms as generic as possible.
Nonetheless, for using third-party software like direct solvers it is necessary to access the
internal data.
This is possible in MTL4 but we have warn the users that types cannot be as flexibly substituted
as in generic applications and data structures may be corrupted.
However, we assume that programmers at this level are aware of the risks.

\section direct_compressed2D Compressed Matrices

The class mat::compressed2D contains three STL vectors: 
- starts,
- indices, and 
- data.
.
The %vector starts contains the first offset of each major index, 
i.e. each row (or column for column-major matrices)
plus an extra entry with the number of non-zeros (which corresponds to the past-end offset 
of the last major index).
The %vector indices contains the column indices (or row  for column-major matrices i.e. minor indices)
of each entry (offset) and data the according value.
For a short description see for instance
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_.28CSR_or_CRS.29">wikipedia</a>.

\subsection direct_compressed2D_ref Access by Reference

For convenience (and lazyness) the data %vector is public and be accessed directly.
To access the other two vectors, one can use the member functions:
- ref_major() and
- ref_minor()
.
that are defined in a constant and mutable way.

\subsection direct_compressed2D_pointer Access by Pointer

There are three member functions that directly return the address of the according first vector entry:
- address_major() for the starts;
- address_minor() for the indices; and
- address_data() for the data.
.

\section direct_dense2D Dense Matrices and Vectors

The data of mat::dense2D and dense_vector
can be accessed in the same manner. The values are stored in an array
called "data" that is public as well (for the sake of laziness).
The address of the first entry is also returned by the member function:
- address_data() 
.
that is provided as constant or mutable pointer depending on the constancy of the matrix or vector.

*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page performance_tuning Performance Tuning

MTL4 is implemented with the goal of maximal performance under the constraint of maximal applicability.
Many operations are specialized when specific types allow for faster algorithms.
This is all realized in the library and does not require activities from the user.
The user can however improve his performance by choosing the most appropriate data type:
- Fixed vs. static size;
- Using 32 bit integers on a 64 bit machine;
- Using single precision preconditioners for double precision matrices.
.
Some operations can be controlled by static parameters, see \ref customizable_parameters.
Their defaults are chosen such that they are near-optimal on most platforms.
Nonetheless, the users are invited to experiment with it and provide us feedback.

\section tuning_fsize Using Fixed-size Matrices and Vectors

If you have small dense matrices or vectors whose dimensions are already known at compile time,
you should use the fixed-size parameters fixed::dimensions and fixed::dimension
in  mat::parameters and parameters.
The following example illustrates its usage:

\include fixed_size_example.cpp

The matrix and vector constructors do not require the dimensions as they are already given in the type.
If desired they can be defined.
This has two advantages:
- It is easier to switch between static and dynamic sizes in the type definitions.
- Generic functions that construct new matrices and vectors can use the same constructor interface
  for statically and dynamically sized objects.
.
If the dimension is specified in the constructor it is compared with the fixed dimension in debug
mode (NDEBUG is not defined) and an exception is thrown when they are inconsistent.

As you can see from the example, the operations are written in the same fashion as for dynamic sizes.
The operations are dispatched so that the entire calculation is performed without a loop
(to be sure we read the assembler generated by gcc).
For the matrix multiplication we realized that only for very small matrices the unrolling is faster.
The default criterion is that the matrix product is performed by a loop if one of the matrices
has more than 10 entries, to change this default see \ref customizable_parameters.

Matrices and vectors of fixed size -- no matter what size they have -- are stored by default on the stack
in terms of a one-dimensional array.
Often the stack size is limited (e.g. to 65636 byte) and too large containers are rejected during compilation.
It is possible to store fixed-size containers on the heap by setting the OnStack argument to false:
\code
    typedef parameters<tag::col_major, fixed::dimension<2>, false> fvec_para;
    typedef mat::parameters<tag::row_major, mtl::index::c_index, mtl::fixed::dimensions<2, 2>, false> fmat_para;
\endcode
The loop unrolling also applies on heap-stored matrices and vectors but the performance is usually lower
due to decreased data locality.


\section tuning_type_arguments Type Arguments

Type parameters in MTL4 are chosen for maximal index ranges and best (feasible) accuracy.
Often this maximum is not needed and many applications can be accelerated by reducing
the index range or the floating point precision.

\subsection tuning_size_type Reducing the Size Type

Using only 32 bit integers instead of 64 bit can accelerate sparse matrix operations 
significantly because twice as much indices can be loaded from memory at the same time 
-- and as we all know, memory bandwidth is the limiting factor in sparse algebra.
Of course 16 bit integers could accelerate it further but then you are limited to 
65636 rows, columns, and non-zeros.

Changing the size type is simply done in mat::parameters :

\include size_type_example.cpp

In the example above we used "unsigned" that is typically 32 bit on 64 bit platforms.
On 32 bit platforms it may be 16 bit long.A
To be independent on the platform's word size one can use uint32 or uint32_t which
comes from the C99 standard and is not portable under C++.
Portability is provided by 
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/integer/cstdint.htm">boost::integer</a> as in the following example:

\include size_type_example2.cpp

Using signed integers is not tested so far.  
We do not expect any error when signed integers are used but several 
compiler warnings that signed and unsigned integers are compared.
Due to the conversion rules of C++ in operations even 16 bit unsigned may cause this warning in some places.
You can send such warnings to us and we will avoid them in future versions.

\subsection tuning_value_type Reducing the Value Type


Iterative solvers (cf. \ref using_solvers) are usually performed with double or higher precision to
reduce numeric instabilities. 
However, the preconditioning is usually less critical and can be realized with lower precision
(cf. e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465504005016" target="_blank">here</a>).
For this purpose, the a second template argument can be provided in our preconditioners:

\include ilu_0_float_cg_example.cpp

The example illustrates that computing with mixed precision requires only changing one line
(the one with the preconditioner type).

Accordingly, one can reduce the precision of complex values:

\include ilu_0_complex_cg_example.cpp

Please note that mixing single and double precision complex numbers does not work with standard C++ only.
We extended the implementation of the four standard operations in order to operate generically on
complex numbers.
For using mixed complex arithmetic you must include the complete MTL4
or boost/numeric/mtl/operation/extended_complex.hpp, see also \ref mixed_complex.

*/

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page namespace_qualification Namespace qualification

All classes and functions are defined in %namespace mtl or sub-namespaces thereof.
Matrix-related functions and types are defined in mtl::matrix and vector material likewise
in mtl::vector.
To make applications shorter, often used types like compressed2D and dense_vector are imported into
the namespace mtl.
As a consequence, you can write mtl::compressed2D<..> or mtl::mat::compressed2D<..>.

Functions are defined as much as possible in the namespaces mtl::matrix and mtl::vector.
Therefore, Argument-Dependent Lookup (ADL) finds these functions without namespace qualification.
For instance, if we call trans(x) the mtl::mat::trans() is called if x is a %matrix, i.e.
the type of x is defined in mtl::matrix.
Likewise if x is a %vector.
If the type of x is not defined in MTL4, you must qualify the function because ADL does not apply.
Alternatively, you can import your type into the appropriate namespace:
\code
namespace mtl { namespace matrix {
    using my_namespace::my_matrix_type;
}}
\endcode
In both cases you would also need a handful of type %traits (the documentation of integrating external types
into MTL4 is pending).

To avoid all namespace qualifications, you can use 
\code
using namespace mtl;
\endcode
in your program before you use the first MTL4 item.
For small programs this is probably the easiest solution.

If you work at a larger project, it is better not importing the entire namespace.
Instead you have to qualify all types and NOT qualify the functions.
If you call mtl::trans it will not find it because it is defined in sub-namespaces.
In general, you should avoid explicit qualification as mtl::f(...).

Functions with
a special behavior are those which are defined upon MTL4 types and non-MTL4 types at the same type.
An example is size(). Like trans it is defined in  mtl::matrix and mtl::vector.
It also works for std::vector and for arrays.
The definitions of these functions are in namespace mtl (we did not like defining it in std:: or the global namespace).
The best way using such functions is
\code
using mtl::size;
unsigned n= size(x);
\endcode
This works for all supported types of x.
If x is a matrix then mtl::mat::size is called and if x is a std::vector mtl::size is called (which is
implemented with partially specialized functor but this is another topic).

As a rule of thumb. If you call an unqualified function for an MTL4 type ADL will find it (otherwise it is sloppily implemented
and must be %fixed).
If you call an MTL4 function for a non-MTL4 type write using mtl::f before calling f.
For generic functions that handle both MTL4 and non-MTL4 types also write using mtl::f.
If it still not compile, the function is probably not implemented yet.

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page copying Copying in MTL4

Shallow copy -- i.e. copying data types with complex internal structures 
by only copying pointers at the upper level -- allows for very short
run-time since most of the data is not copied physically but only referred
to in the target object.
The draw-back is that changing either of the objects involved in a shallow
copy will alter the other object too.
Especially in complex mathematical applications this often leads to errors
hard to track down.

For that very reason we refrained from shallow copy semantics in assignments,
that is after 
\code 
x= y; 
\endcode one can change x or y without any impact on
the other object, see also \ref shallow_copy_problems.

\section copy_sub_matrix Copying Sub-matrices

Sub-matrices are a special case.
The expression
\code 
Matrix E= A[irange(2, 5)][irange(1, 9)] // or sub_matrix(A, 2, 5, 1, 9);
\endcode
means that E is defined as a mutable sub-matrix of A.
Internally this is realized as a view on some of A's values.
One could compare this to a window on A. 
As a result, modifications of E affect A and modifications of A change
E if the change was in the range of rows and columns that E refers to.
This  admittedly behaves similarly to shallow copy behavior but is nevertheless
different.
In the case of a sub-matrix, we explicitly request aliasing.
The modification of A can easily prevented by a const argument
\code 
const Matrix E= A[irange(2, 5)][irange(1, 9)] 
\endcode
Furthermore, the sub-matrix of a const %matrix (or another const sub-matrix)
is const itself.
Unless explicitly casted away, const-ness is conserved within MTL4
and cannot be circumvented like in other libraries with shallow copy assignment.
Resuming, the construction of a %matrix with sub_matrix is not a
shallow copy but the definition of a reference to a part of another %matrix.

Once sub-matrix is defined, assignments are regular deep copies, i.e.
\code
E= B;
\endcode
copies the values of B to E and implicitly to the corresponding entries of A.
Sub-matrices are not move semantics, i.e.
\code
E= f(B);
\endcode
cannot use move semantics.
It is correct regarding the destruction of the temporaries and the values of E
but not concerning the modifications of A, which we defined E being a sub-matrix of.

If you do not want the aliasing behavior of sub_matrix but are only interested
in the values of the sub-matrix, you can use the function \ref clone.
\code 
Matrix F= clone(A[irange(2, 5)][irange(1, 9)]);
\endcode
Then deep copy is explicitly used.
F and A are thus entirely decoupled: any modification of either of them
will not affect the other.

Any older remarks on inconsistencies between copy construction and assignment
are invalid now.
In addition, every expression that can be assigned can also be used in copy
constructors, e.g.:
\code
compressed2D<double> A(B * C * D + E);
\endcode

//-----------------------------------------------------------

/*! \page shallow_copy_problems Why Not Using Shallow Copy in Numerical Software

Shallow copy has the advantage over deep copy of being considerably faster.
This advantage does not justify all the dangers implied.

\section scp_unawareness Unawareness

The first risk is that many programmers are not aware of the aliasing
behavior, which is that 
after the assignment neither of the two arguments can be modified without 
affecting the other.
As one of the two variables can be changed in a sub-function of a sub-function of a ...
it is hard to track down all possible modifications.

\section scp_type_dependence Type Dependence of Copy behavior


Moreover, the problem is even more confusing.
Since shallow copy semantic is only feasible between objects of the same type,
assignments between different types must copy data deeply.
In generic functions aiming for maximal generality one do not want assume or
require equality or distinctness of argument types so that the copy behavior 
is unknown.

\include shallow_copy_problems_type.cpp

\section scp_operations Impact of Mathematically Neutral Operations


In the same way mathematically neutral operations like multiplications with one
or additions of zero vectors silently change the program behavior by 
disabling shallow copies and eliminating the aliasing behavior.

\code
A= B;           // Aliasing of A and B
A= 1.0 * B;     // A and B are independent
\endcode

\section scp_obfuscations Code Obfuscation

Many higher level libraries like ITL assigns vectors with the
copy function instead of the assignment operator in order to guarantee deep
copy.

\code 
A= B;           // (Potential) shallow copy
copy(B, A);     // Deep copy
\endcode

We refrain from this approach because this syntax does not correspond to the
mathematical literature and more importantly we cannot be sure that all users
of a library will replace assignments by copy.




\section scp_undermining Undermining const Attributes


Last  but not least
all shallow copy implementations we have seen so far
relentlessly undermined const attributes of arguments.


\include shallow_copy_problems_const.cpp

After calling f, A is modified despite it was passed as const argument and the 
const-ness was not even casted away.

\section scp_resume Resume

For all these reasons we are convinced that reliable mathematical software
can only be implemented with
deep copy semantics.
Unnecessary copies can be avoided by using advanced techniques as expression
templates and \ref move_semantics.

//-----------------------------------------------------------


/*! \page peak_addiction Addicted to peak performance

Sooner or later it comes the day when new software is benchmarked against existing one.
We believe that we achieved very good performance for C++ standards.
But we are still conceivably slower than hand-tuned machine language codes.
We addressed this issue with a similar strategy as Python did.

Python solves the problem of lower performance by not solving it.
Instead, an interface to C/C++ named SWIG was established.
Now people write core components in performance-critical parts with C/C++
and use them in Python.
This way they benefit of the expressiveness of Python with run-time
behavior comparable to C/C++.

Similarly, we stopped trying to reach peak performance at any rate.
Often the medicilously arranged register choreography of some numeric tools
implemented in assembly language cannot be generated by most compiler as efficiently.

In numbers: while many tuned BLAS libraries reach over 90 per cent peak
performance in dense %matrix multiplication, we achieve typically 60 - 70 per cent peak.
This said, we terminated pushing C++ programs further into areas that today's
compilers are not capable to support.

If tuned BLAS libraries reach such high performance--after a lot of hard work though--why
do not use it? 
Following the antic piece of wisdom "If you can't beat them, join them".

So, we internally (we hesitate to say automagically) use the tuned libraries.
That usage remains transparent to the user.
This way we can provide BLAS performance with a more elegant programming style.
(\ref performance_disclaimer)

In addition, our library is not limited to certain types nor to %operations with
arguments of the same type.
We are able to handle mixed %operations, e.g., multiplying float matrices with double vectors.
And of course, we support matrices and vectors of all suitable user and built-in types.
In both cases, we provide decent performance.

Resuming, assembly libraries allow for maximal speed on a rather limited number of types.
Advanced template programming establishes almost competitive performance on an infinite set of types 
while enabling the assembly performance where available.
So, one can write applications with matrices and vectors of genuine or user-defined types
and enjoy maximal available speed.
And we dare to bore the reader with the repetition of the fact that applications only contain
code like A = B * C and the library chooses the optimal implementation.
So, what do you have to loose except that your programs look nicer?

/*! \page performance_athlon Performance on an AMD Opteron 2GHz


The following measurements are performed with
 the benchmark template library (BTL) from Laurent Plagne.

The first benchmark is the product of a dense matrix 
with its transposed, i.e. A * trans(A):

\image html athlon/bench-aat.png
\image latex athlon/bench-aat.eps "Matrix product $AA^T$." width=10cm

This operation is favorable for row-major matrices because they are processed with stride 1.
As a consequence the C and C++ implementations perform well for large matrices compared
with the Fortran implementation (where both arguments are traversed with long strides).
The MTL4 implementation is even less affected by the matrix size thanks to the recursive approach.

The implementation uses tiling on block-level (typically 64 by 64).
For the considered processor a tiling of 2 by 4 yields the performance while processors with more
available FP registers (e.g. PowerPC) are faster with 4 by 4 tiling.
The metaprogramming tuning in MTL4 allows the user to define these parameters in type definitions
of functors and the unrolled implementation is generated at compile time.

In this measurement, the benchmark was compiled without -DMTL_HAS_BLAS (/DMTL_HAS_BLAS on MSVC).
If we had enabled BLAS in MTL4, the two curves would have been identical.

The second example transposes the first argument in the dense matrix product, i.e. trans(A) * A.
This operation is correspondingly more appropriate for column-major matrices so that the
Fortran implementation scales better than the C/C++ codes:

\image html athlon/bench-ata.png
\image latex athlon/bench-ata.eps "Matrix product $A^TA$." width=10cm

As for MTL4, the performance is decreased as well with respect to the first benchmark but
the effect is limited due to the recursive implementation.

Multiplying matrices of the same orientation without transposition, i.e. A * A, scales poorly for 
row-major and column-major if no blocking is used:

\image html athlon/bench-matrix_matrix.png
\image latex athlon/bench-matrix_matrix.eps "Matrix product $AA$." width=10cm

As for the previous measurements, the nested blocking of GotoBLAS and the recursive blocking
of MTL4 cope with the locality problems of large matrices.
In this plot, we also compare with the performance of using recursive matrix formats.
The trend is similar to traditional row-major layout but the performance behaves more stably.
While row-major matrices with strides that are large powers of two introduce a fair amount
of cache conflicts the improved locality of the recursive layout minimizes such conflicts.

The following benchmark considers a different operation, which is 
x= alpha * y + beta * z with alpha and beta scalars and x, y, z vectors.

\image html athlon/bench-vecbinexpr.png
\image latex athlon/bench-vecbinexpr.eps "x= alpha y + beta z." width=10cm

Most modern libraries use expression templates for this calculation so that all
operations are performed in one single loop.

Finally, we managed outperforming GotoBLAS in one function at least for some sizes:

\image html athlon/bench-dot.png
\image latex athlon/bench-dot.eps "Dot product." width=10cm

The dot product in this plot used internally unrolling with block size 8.
Please note that this is compiler generated code not unrolled by hand.

Thanks to Laurent Plagne for his support with the BTL and to Chris Cole for running the
programs on a cluster node at Indiana University.

\remark
Performance measurings labeled MTL represent computations with MTL2.
MTL2 was tuned for KCC and achieved excellent performance with this compiler (cf. 
<a href="http://osl.iu.edu/research/mtl/performance.php3">MTL2 performance</a>).
With MTL4 we did not rely on compilers for tiling, loop unrolling and similar transformations.
There are two reasons for this: one is that compilers have very different behavior in this regard.
The other reason is that many transformation rely on mathematical properties as commutativity 
that are not known for user types and/or user-defined operations so that compiler optimization is limited
to build-in types and operations.
To cope with this, we implemented accelerating transformation by meta-programming and count
on compilers regarding efficient inlining and reference forwarding.
Our meta-programming optimizations -- short meta-tuning -- proved high efficiency in multiple
measurings (the plots above are only few examples) and were always as fast as code directly 
written in unrolled/tiled form.

It uses C++11 features and might require setting the corresponding flags on your compiler.
We will work on new implementations to make such applications even shorter (e.g. the inversion of fixed-size
matrices will be soon part of the library).

/*! \page matrix_free Matrix-free operations

Given the significant performance gap between floating point operations and memory access
(which fortunately decreased in the last years)
matrix-free methods became quite popular.
On this page we like to demonstrate how a matrix-free linear operator can be implemented in MTL4.

\section matrix_free_simple Simple example

We start with a relatively simple implementation of an operator that represents a 5-point stencil
for a Poisson operator on a 2D rectangular domain:

\include matrix_free_1.cpp

Unfortunately, the type trait ashape::ashape_aux is necessary to avoid ambiguities.
MTL4 considers all unknown types as scalars which is handy most of the time but less convenient
in this case.

Despite the type trait the example is still relatively simple.
But it is not very efficient.
Firstly, it contains four ifs in the inner loop.
Secondly, the resulting vector is copied back.
Current compilers are already quite smart eliminate copies of return values
and C++11 offers rvalue-semantics to avoid such copies wherever possible.
Nonetheless, creating a new object with dynamic memory is still expensive.
In the following performance trace we used the Poisson operator in a conjugate gradient
method with a 1000 by 1000 domain:

\image html matrix_free_cg_slow_vampir.png

The processor used in this benchmark is somewhat dated: AMD Phentom(tm) 9150e.
The Poisson operator runs with about 440MFlops and takes about 11ms.
The impact of copying the result vector is not taken into account because it happens after the 
function end and let the following function seem slower.

For comparison, here is the same calculation with an explicitly stored matrix:

\image html unfused_matrix_cg_vampir.png

The performance of the matrix vector product is with about 370MFlops not much lower.
However, the run-time is significantly higher: around 27ms.
This disproportion is a particular phenomenon of this stencil. 
The off-diagonal entries are -1 so that multiplication with -1 and the subsequent addition can 
be replaced by a subtraction.
Thus the same behavior is achieved with 5 FP operations instead of 9.
Unfortunately, a reduction of operations due to the matrix-free representations 
only happens for special
cases, e.g., if 1 or -1 are part of the stencil.

In the following sections, we will work on faster implementations.


\section matrix_free_branchfree Faster stencil computation

The elimination of the branching in the loop is not a challenge at the programming level
but rather a question of patience.
After rearranging the calculation we got rid of all branches:

\include matrix_free_2.cpp

Now we can address the issue of vector copy.

\section matrix_free_copyfree Avoiding the copy of the resulting vector

Creating new vectors is quite expensive (we measured this several times).
It is not only the time for the dynamic construction and destruction but also
memory access is slower subsequently (cache and TLB misses).
Even with a fair amount of calculations like a matrix vector product or 
a preconditioner the overhead is not amortized.
C++11 offers move semantics that allows avoiding to copy temporary vectors;
this is a significant improvement but still perceivably slower than performing the calculations 
directly in the target vector.

For this purpose, we write our multiplication in a member function called mult
that takes the target vector as a mutable reference.
To use this function for incrementing and decrementing we also pass a functor as third argument.
Now we can compute the product of A and v and assign it to w2 by:
\code 
  A.mult(v, w2, mtl::assign::assign_sum()); // w2= A * v;
\endcode
without copying the result to w2.

Likewise we can increment and decrement the vectors:
\code 
  A.mult(v, w2, mtl::assign::plus_sum());  // w2+= A * v;
  A.mult(v, w2, mtl::assign::minus_sum()); // w2-= A * v;
\endcode
This is of course everything else than elegant.

To enable a natural notation we define an operator* that returns an object with references
to A and v.
The multiplication is later performed during the assignment to the target vector.
This delayed evaluation is achieved by the class mat_cvec_multiplier.
The details of its implementation are a bit tricky are omitted here.
What is important for the user is to define the free functions:
- size
- num_rows
- num_cols
.
and the typetraits:
- Collection (in namespace mtl)
- ashape (in namespace mtl::ashape).
.
These functions and type traits are needed in MTL4 functions like the iterative solvers
and must be provided by the matrix-free linear operator.

An example of a copy-free implementation reads:

\include matrix_free_3.cpp

If you run this code on large examples you should see significantly better performance than with the
previous implementations.

\section matrix_free_solver Matrix-free solver

The matrix-free linear operator from the previous section can be used in most solvers, 
e.g., conjugate gradients:

\include matrix_free_cg.cpp

For further acceleration one can unroll the inner loop of the first block and store
reused vector elements in temporaries as in mat::poisson2D_dirichlet.
Then the Poisson operator takes only 5.2-5.5ms on the same processor while at the same time
the following operation is less slowed down.
This corresponds to a performance of 940-970MFlops:

\image html matrix_free_cg_vampir.png

This implementation clearly outperforms explicitly stored matrices.
(If we would perform the same FP operations -- i.e.
multiply with -1 instead of subtracting -- 
the operator takes slightly over 6ms and performs at almost 1.4GFlops on the test machine.)
On the other hand the product of a CRS matrix with a vector provides an OpenMP acceleration
that can multiply the performance.
Please note that the
 impact of OpenMP in sparse operations depends mainly on the number of memory channels
and only minimally on the number of cores.

Of course, the matrix-free operator can use OpenMP as well but
it has to implemented by the user.
Fortunately, this should not be very hard.

The operator cannot be used with solvers that utilize an adjoint operator 
(i.e. a transposed or conjugate transposed matrix): bicg and qmr.
All other solvers work with the presented solution.
On (sufficient) demand we can add this feature.

\section matrix_free_pc Matrix-free preconditioning

Except the pseudo-preconditioner itl::pc::identity, MTL4's preconditioner need a
real matrix for factorization or at least accessing the diagonal.
Therefore, they will not work with a matrix-free operator.

You will need to define yourself a matrix-free preconditioner in the same manner as before.
That is writing a function that operates on a vector and computes a new one.
The main difference is that the class should provide a function solve (instead of mult).
If the adjoint preconditioning is used - it is in bicg and qmr - 
you must also define a function adjoint_solve.


The evaluation can be delayed by using the helper class itl::pc::solver.
The free function solve (to be defined in the same namespace as your preconditioner)
must return an object of type itl::pc::solver parameterized with your preconditioner
and the vector argument type.

The following examples illustrates how to define a diagonal preconditioner for the 2D
Poisson equation:

\include matrix_free_pcg.cpp

Admittedly, the preconditioning is useless for a constant diagonal and the distinction
between solve and adjoint_solve is not necessary here either.

However, the example demonstrates how a matrix-free preconditioner can be incorporated into
MTL4.

/*! \page faq FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

-# \ref faq_one_based
-# \ref mtl4_part_of_boost
-# \ref mtl4_in_linux_distributions
-# \ref traits_error


\section faq_not_inserting I always get the error "Assertion failed: !(inserting)" or an exception of type "access_during_insertion" is thrown.

This is the single-most often occurring error people experience when starting with MTL4.

The problem is that certain objects cannot be accessed during insertion, in particular
sparse and distributed matrices.

The following program fragment is wrong:
\code
using namespace mtl;
typedef compressed2D<double> matrix_type;

matrix_type A(5, 5);
mat::inserter<matrix_type> ins(A);
ins[0][0] << 7.3; // .... more insertions

do_something_with(A);  // TROUBLE!!!
\endcode
In this code, A is used before it is ready.

The insertion is only finished when the inserter is destroyed.
This can be achieved in two ways:
- Defining it in an extra scope; and
- Allocating it dynamically and deleting the pointer (like \ref multiple_insertion "this").

An extra scope is implicitly used when the insertion is performed in a separate function,
as done \ref element_insertion "here".

The easiest way to destroy the inserter is to enclose the insertion in braces:
\code
using namespace mtl;
typedef compressed2D<double> matrix_type;

matrix_type A(5, 5);
{
    mat::inserter<matrix_type> ins(A);
    ins[0][0] << 7.3; 
}                      // ins is destroyed here
do_something_with(A);  // and A is ready to use
\endcode
For more information read \ref destroy_inserter "this".

\section mtl4_part_of_boost Is MTL4 part of boost?

No. But it has the same directory structure as boost with the intention
of easier inclusion.
Probably, we will apply for a boost revision with the open source edition some day.

\section faq_one_based How can I specify in the template parameters in compressed2D that the matrix should be stored in one-based indexing?

You can not.

In the very early days of MTL4 we started writing code to support the different indexing scheme but it turned out to become a nightmare, especially when it comes to mixed index schemes.  Using one-based indexing in pure C++ code is also prone to performance losses.  For that reasons we decided to leave it out.  

If there is enough demand, we could have transformation functions to increment and decrement indices explicitly before and after calling Fortran functions. This of course is also prone to errors.

A popular trick to have one-based matrices is adding a row and a column and inserting them into a 0-based matrix as it was a 1-based.  When calling the Fortran functions one can pass the addresses of the data and column arrays and the row array + one.
\code
  A.address_major() + 1  
\endcode


\section mtl4_in_linux_distributions Are there plans to become part of Linux distributions

Yes. This is planned for the open source edition.

\section traits_error "xyz" is not defined namespace mtl::mat::traits

This should not happen and we hope that we already eradicated this error. 
In fact, there were no problems reported recently.

The trouble comes from the fact that there are namespaces traits in mtl as well
as in mtl::matrix.
Within namespace mtl::matrix, the name traits::xyz is searched in mtl::mat::traits
not in mtl::traits.

The quick solution is to replace traits::xyz by mtl::traits::xyz to nominate the namespace
explicitly.

The best solution is to send us (mtl4@osl.iu.edu) a bug report and we will fix it for everybody.
